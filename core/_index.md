# PKW Core Bundle (Globe Layer)

This folder is the **globe layer** for PKW.
It contains global routing, constraints, registries, and conventions.

It does **not** contain world/place content.
Worlds (like Hollowverse / Forest of Illusions) remain in their own bundles.

## Primary docs
- [CONSTRAINTS.md](CONSTRAINTS.md)
- [BUNDLE_REGISTRY.md](BUNDLE_REGISTRY.md)
- [NAMING_RULES.md](NAMING_RULES.md)
- [EXPORT_RULES.md](EXPORT_RULES.md)

## Workflows

## Canonical stance
- PKW Core defines rules that apply across all worlds.
- Worlds, assets, and chat systems are registered separately.
- If something is not registered, it is non-canon until declared.

## Rule
If a decision must remain true across multiple worlds, it belongs in PKW Core.
