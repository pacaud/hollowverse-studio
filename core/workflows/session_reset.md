# Workflow: Session Reset (New Chat)

Goal: reset chat without losing important context.

## Safe reset checklist
1) Key decisions are written into MD files (core/world/chat_center)
2) Registries are updated (if new bundles were created)
3) You have a short checkpoint note:
   - what was completed
   - what is next
   - which bundle to load next

## Recommended checkpoint line
"Core vX.Y.Z complete. Next: start pkw_chat_center bundle."
