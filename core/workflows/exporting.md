# Workflow: Exporting (Step-by-step)

Use this as the practical checklist when exporting a bundle.

## Steps
1) Confirm you are exporting **one bundle**
2) Confirm there is a top-level `_index.md`
3) Check size target (< ~400MB active)
4) Avoid nested zips (max 1 legacy sub-zip)
5) Export to a versioned `*.bundle.zip`
6) Download and sanity-check the zip
7) Upload to chat for the session
8) If this is a new bundle, register it in:
   - [`../BUNDLE_REGISTRY.md`](../BUNDLE_REGISTRY.md)

## Authority
