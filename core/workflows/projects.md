# Workflow: Projects (PKW vs Git)

Use this when you're unsure where something belongs.

## Quick decision
- If it's **lore/system/canon** → PKW bundles
- If it's **code/build/deploy** → git repo (project), not PKW
- If it's **both**:
  - put the canon/design notes in PKW
  - keep the actual code in the repo
