# Workflow: Versioning

Goal: keep versions calm and predictable.

## Patch bump (x.y.z)
Use when:
- typos
- wording tweaks
- small clarifications
- no structural changes

## Minor bump (x.y.0)
Use when:
- new files/folders
- new workflow docs
- new systems added (non-breaking)

## Major bump (x.0.0)
Use when:
- routing changes
- large reorganizations
- breaking path/name changes
