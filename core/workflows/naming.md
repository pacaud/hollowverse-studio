# Workflow: Naming (Quick Apply)

Use this when you are about to create a new bundle or new folder entrypoint.

## Bundle naming (quick)
1) Pick a scope: `core | world | assets | chat_center`
2) Optional name (only when needed): `__<name>`
3) Pick a version: start `v0.1.0`
4) Final format:
   - `pkw_<scope>__<name_optional>__v<semver>.bundle.zip`

## Folder entrypoints
- Every folder gets an `_index.md` as its doorway.

## Authority
For the official standard, see:
