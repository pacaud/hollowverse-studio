# drift_snow

status: seeded
type: weather
region: forest_of_illusions

[vibe]
quiet, slow, soft winter

[description]
Light snow that drifts and settles without harsh wind.
It makes the forest feel padded and still.

[effects_on_places]
- cottage_return_path stays walkable (never icy-dangerous)
- nightglow_hollow becomes extra luminous at night
- stump_table_circle looks like a tiny winter camp

[effects_on_fauna]
- ribbon_deer tracks appear near clearing edges
- moss_tortoise is rarely seen (resting)

[use]
- winter-cozy scenes
- “everything is softer” mood
