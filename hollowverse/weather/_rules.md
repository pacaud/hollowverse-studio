# Weather Rules (Forest of Illusions)

[canon_rule]
- Weather is **scene support**, not a system.
- Weather never “punishes” or traps. It only shifts mood.

[layer_rule]
- Weather overlays terrain + vegetation + animals.
- If something feels too heavy, mark it as **rumor** or **legend** instead of deleting it.

[safety]
- No extreme survival conditions.
- Storms (if any) are brief and non-destructive.

[use_style]
- Mention weather in scenes as a **one-line texture** unless it’s a special moment.
