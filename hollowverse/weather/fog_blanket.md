[vibe]
hush, slow pacing, held

[description]
Fog gathers low and steady, like a blanket laid across the forest floor.
Visibility shortens, but the mood becomes softer, not scarier.

[effects_on_places]
- mist_loop_trail becomes a perfect reset walk
- fogquiet_clearing feels like a private room outdoors
- cottage_stream sounds closer

[effects_on_fauna]
- mist_fox may appear at a respectful distance
- night_moth becomes more noticeable near dusk

[use]
- grounding
- “let’s go slower” scenes
