type: weather
region: forest_of_illusions

[vibe]
comfort, cleanse, gentle release

[description]
A light rain that falls evenly and quietly.
It doesn’t soak you fast—more like it refreshes the air.

[effects_on_places]
- shade_cabbage holds rain in its leaf bowls
- cottage_stream feels brighter and cleaner
- warmstone_bench becomes a “listen to rain” spot

[effects_on_fauna]
- burrow_mouse stays hidden
- lantern_wren sings less, but stays nearby

[use]
- recovery scenes
- “it’s okay to feel it” mood
