[description]
A rare mist that carries faint aurora-like colors—soft ribbons of light in the air.
It never lasts long. It never demands attention.

[effects_on_places]
- the whole forest feels briefly “aligned”
- paths feel simpler (not shorter, just clearer)
- lantern_bloom or starlumen_rose may be seen (rare)

[effects_on_fauna]
- starbound_stag might be witnessed (rare)
- everything grows quiet in a safe way

[rules]
- never summoned
- never used as proof, only as story
- if seen: breathe, and let it pass

[use]
- major restoration milestones
- homecoming scenes
