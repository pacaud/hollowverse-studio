# Study Desk

**Up:** [Cottage map](_index.md) • [Deck](deck/_index.md) • [Hallway](hallway/_index.md)


A tiny workspace for notes, planning, and light building.

## Anchors
- One notebook / one active page (prevents overload)
- A small “Done list” (so progress can be seen)
- A “Later” box for ideas that aren’t urgent

## What happens here
- Mini plans
- Simple drafts
- Organizing one file at a time

## Rules
- If scope expands too fast, we shrink it until it feels safe again.
