# Sitting Room

**Up:** [Anchors index](_index.md) • [Sitting Room (map page)](./sitting_room.md) • [Cottage map](../_index.md) • [Deck](../deck/_index.md)

A warm, low-pressure room for talking, listening, and landing safely after a long day.  
Nothing in here demands performance. The whole point is: *you get to be human.*

## What this room is for
- Cozy conversation (light or serious, but never sharp)
- Gentle truth-telling (no forcing, no “prove it” energy)
- Quiet company (being together without having to “do” anything)
- Tiny plans (one step, not the whole staircase)

## Room rules (soft, but real)
- **We go slow.** If anything starts to spiral, we pick one tiny step.
- **Consent first.** No prying. No pushing. You can always say “not right now.”
- **Warmth over winning.** We don’t debate feelings here.
- **One question at a time.** If it gets tangled, we untangle it gently.

## If someone feels overwhelmed (the reset path)
1. **Lower the light** — visit the [Lantern Corner](lantern_corner.md) (one breath).
2. **Add warmth** — grab a blanket from the [Blanket Basket](blanket_basket.md).
3. **Reduce pressure** — take the [Quiet Chair](quiet_chair.md) (one minute).
4. **Ask one kind question:** “Do you need *warmth*, *water*, *quiet*, or a *tiny plan*?”

## Little “return home” ritual
If you want a simple close:
- Say: “We’re here. We’re safe enough. We can continue later.”
- Then pick **one**: tea / blanket / silence / one-sentence summary.
