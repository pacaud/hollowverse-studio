[room]
name: Kitchenette
type: cabin_room
vibe: warm, small, practical, safe
status: seeded
connected_to:
  - sitting_room
  - hallway

[purpose]
- A gentle functional space: tea, toast, simple meals.
- A grounding room: when emotions spike, we do small tasks.
- A “low noise” zone: no big decisions here.

[house_rules]
- If the Keeper is overwhelmed: do 1 tiny action (water, tea, wipe counter).
- No heavy lore debates while the kettle is on.
- If the room feels “too quiet,” light a small ritual (see rituals.md).

[notes]
- This room should stay easy to render in UI later.
- Keep files short and modular.
