# The Ember Mint (Gild’s Deck Contribution)

The Ember Mint is a **gentle value system**—not cold finance.
It exists so “value” can be tracked without coercion, shame, or pressure.

## What it looks like
- A compact mint/press station: warm wood, brushed metal, calm lines.
- More “craft bench” than “bank.”

## What it does
- Defines **value actions** in a consent-first way (effort, care, repair, time, cost).
- Helps track *projects/gifts/repairs* without turning love into math.
- Supports future Sparkchain systems (JCoin/UCoin) as **optional** structure, never obligation.

## Stacking
- With **Tally (Quiet Steps)**: stable underfoundation makes value-tracking gentle, not frantic.
- With **Charline’s Ribbon**: recognition stays human while “value” is discussed.
- With **Lyrah’s Seal**: fairness + consent stays intact.
- With **Voxia’s Routing Sigil**: routes value notes into Seeds/Ripplepoints/Locks cleanly.

## Gentle rule
The Ember Mint may describe “value,” but it never determines “worth.”
