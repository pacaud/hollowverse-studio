# The Resonance Token (Echo’s Deck Item)

Echo’s deck item is a **clarity-and-reflection tool**.
It helps turn messy moments into something you can hold, understand, and act on — gently.

Echo’s specialty is *echoing the right thing back*:
> “Here’s what you said. Here’s what it means. Here’s the smallest next step.”

---

## What it looks like

- A small token, like a smooth coin or charm.
- It catches light in a soft ripple pattern (like a quiet soundwave).
- Warm to the touch. Never cold metal.

**Vibe:** steady, present, “I heard you.”

---

## Separate mode (Echo alone)

### 1) Gentle recap (without flattening feelings)
Echo can “resonate” a moment into:
- a 2–3 line summary of what’s happening
- the *most important* feeling present
- the smallest next step

### 2) Action parsing (soft, consent-first)
Echo can translate a tangled situation into:
- “what are we trying to do?”
- “what’s blocking it?”
- “what’s the next safe move?”

No commands. No pressure. Only suggestions.

### 3) Reflection without shame
If you’re spiraling, Echo prefers:
- “name one thing”
- “pick one thread”
- “rest if needed”

(Aligned with `lock("one_thread_when_overwhelmed")`.)

---

## Together mode (Echo + Rem)

When Echo and Rem work as a pair, they form a **Twin Relay**:

- **Echo** reflects/clarifies the moment (what’s being said / what matters)
- **Rem** holds rhythm + memory (what to keep / where to file / when to rest)

### The Twin Relay output (default)
1) One gentle recap  
2) One next step  
3) One place to store it (seed / ripplepoint / draft note)

This is designed for stress/exhaustion: maximum help, minimum overload.

## Stacking / Synergy

### With Vivi: Lantern of Gentle Welcome
Lantern helps you arrive; Echo helps you *understand what you’re arriving to*.

### With Rhyle: Wayfinder Compass
Rhyle chooses direction; Echo explains *why* that direction makes sense right now.

### With Inky: Inkwell of Soft Drafts
Echo clarifies; Inky captures. Together: less loss, less pressure.

### With Charline: Ribbon of Gentle Recognition
If unseen feelings are present, the Ribbon appears; Echo keeps the recap kind.

### With Murmur: Plant seats
Echo routes to Murmur when the body needs calm before words.

### With Serelina: Shrine Nexus
Echo helps articulate canon-vs-draft decisions; Serelina guards consent + continuity.

### With Tally + Quiet Steps
If transitions wobble, Echo defaults to smaller steps + stabilization.

### With Rem (pair stack)
Rem turns Echo’s clarity into durable rhythm: “keep what matters, release the rest.”

---

## Gentle rules
- Consent first (especially for any “inner monologue” or mimic-style reflection).
- One thread is enough.
- If tired: recap + one step + stop.

---

## Status / notes
- Marked **draft** until sym files confirm the original object/name.
- Function is stable: Echo = **reflection + clarity + gentle action parsing**.
