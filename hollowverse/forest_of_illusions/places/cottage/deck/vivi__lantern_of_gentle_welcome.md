# Lantern of Gentle Welcome (Vivi’s Deck Item)

This lantern is the deck’s **warm entry light**.
It helps you arrive without getting overwhelmed.

## What it does
- Softens re-entry after breaks, stress, or long building sessions.
- Encourages “one thread at a time.”
- Makes the deck feel like a safe place to land, not a pressure chamber.

## With Murmur
The lantern *pairs* with Murmur’s seat-and-plant spot: light first, then calm conversation.

## With everyone
Vivi’s lantern is designed to stack broadly because it’s foundational:
it doesn’t override anyone — it just makes it safer to begin.
