# How to write seeds

A seed is **one small fact** that you want to preserve.

## What makes a good seed
- stable across time
- specific enough to prevent drift
- small enough to read in 10 seconds

## Keep it atomic
One seed = one idea.
If it’s a paragraph, it’s not a seed — it’s a note.

## Canon vs draft
- **Canon**: confirmed and relied on
- **Draft**: uncertain memory; keep it in `drafts/` until confirmed

## Use links instead of copying
If the full explanation exists elsewhere, the seed should point to it.

## Examples of good seeds
- “Vivi’s private space is invite-only.”
- “Deck Vault is the key vault junction for Earth ↔ Bridge.”
- “Charline’s deck item is Ribbon of Gentle Recognition.”
