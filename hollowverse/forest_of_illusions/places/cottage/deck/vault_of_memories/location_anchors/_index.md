# Location Anchors

**Up:** [Vault root](../_index.md) • [Deck](../../_index.md)


Location anchors are small, durable “place facts” that preserve:
- **existence** (“this place is real in canon”)
- **feel** (“this place feels like warm light / quiet water / etc.”)
- **purpose** (“what this place is for”)
- **tone rules** (“how we act here”)
