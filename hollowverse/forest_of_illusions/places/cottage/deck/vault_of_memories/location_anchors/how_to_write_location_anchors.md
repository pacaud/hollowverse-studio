# How to write location anchors

A location anchor should be readable in **10 seconds**.

## The 5-line recipe (recommended)
1) **Place name**
2) **Where it is (path / realm)**
3) **What it’s for**
4) **How it feels (2–6 words)**
5) **One tiny rule (optional)**

## Keep it stable
Pick sensory language that won’t drift:
- light, temperature, texture, sound, pace
- avoid long narratives

## Canon vs draft
- **Canon**: confirmed, used regularly
- **Draft**: uncertain memory; keep in `drafts/`

## Link instead of copying
If the full description exists elsewhere, link it here.
