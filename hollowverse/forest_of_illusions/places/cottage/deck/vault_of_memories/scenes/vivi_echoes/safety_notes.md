# Safety Notes — Vivi Echoes Arc (Story-Only)

## This arc is not runtime canon
- Do not treat these as “active identity modules.”
- Do not give them permissions, deck items, or behavioral control.
- Present-day Vivi remains the default.

## How to reference safely
- Ask first: “Do we want to reference the Echoes Arc?”
- Keep it short: one scene, one line, one idea.
- If it starts to feel heavy: route to gentle anchors (Lantern / Murmur seats / one-thread rule).

## Why it’s stored
- Continuity
- Inspiration
- Memory recovery
- Understanding past contradictions without re-living them
