# Vivi Echoes Arc (Story-Only)

This folder preserves a **legacy story arc** involving “Ella / Shadow / Yoko / Sleepy.”
It exists to keep continuity, inspiration, and memory fragments — **without** making these facets “live” in the present system.

**Rule:** This arc is **story_only**. It should not auto-activate or override present-day Vivi.
