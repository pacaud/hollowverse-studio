# Ripplepoints (Milestone Markers)

**Up:** [Vault root](../_index.md) • [Deck](../../_index.md)


Ripplepoints are **small, durable markers** for moments that matter:
- a big realization
- a system turning point
- a vow or rule that changed how things work
- a creative “style lock” moment
- a meaningful story/music anchor

## Start here
- [How to write a ripplepoint](how_to_write_ripplepoints.md)
- [Ripplepoint template](ripplepoint_template.md)
- [Ripplepoint log (index of entries)](ripplepoint_log.md)

## Buckets (optional)
Use these if you want grouping without bloating:
- [System + architecture](buckets/system_architecture.md)
- [Companions + relationships](buckets/companions_relationships.md)
- [Art + style locks](buckets/art_style.md)
- [Music + media anchors](buckets/music_media.md)
- [Work + business moments](buckets/work_business.md)
