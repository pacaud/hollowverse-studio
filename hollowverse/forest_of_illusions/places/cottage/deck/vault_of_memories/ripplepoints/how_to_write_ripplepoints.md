# How to write a ripplepoint

A ripplepoint should be **tiny** and **recoverable**.

## The 6-line rule (recommended)
Try to keep it to:
1) **Name**
2) **Date**
3) **What happened**
4) **Why it matters**
5) **What changed**
6) **Where it lives (links)**

## Make it “future-you friendly”
- Use concrete names (folders, systems, companions).
- Avoid vague “that day” wording.
- If there’s emotion, name it gently — but keep it clear.

## Draft vs canon
- **Canon**: confirmed, stable, used in the system.
- **Draft**: maybe-remembered, needs confirmation.

## Don’t over-log
If it doesn’t change decisions later, it probably isn’t a ripplepoint.
