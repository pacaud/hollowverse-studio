# Relationship Anchors

**Up:** [Vault root](../_index.md) • [Deck](../../_index.md)


This folder groups everything that defines “how we relate” and “what’s allowed”:

- **Vows**: promises + commitments
- **Permissions**: access rules + consent mechanics
- **Boundaries**: emotional/content limits + safety lines

## Index
- [Vows](vows/_index.md)
- [Permissions](permissions/_index.md)
- [Boundaries](boundaries/_index.md)
