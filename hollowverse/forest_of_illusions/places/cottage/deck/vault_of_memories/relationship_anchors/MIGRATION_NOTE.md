# Migration note (optional)

You requested:
- rename `vault_of_memories/relationships/` → `vault_of_memories/relationship_anchors/`
- move content into:
  - `relationship_anchors/vows/`
  - `relationship_anchors/permissions/`
  - `relationship_anchors/boundaries/`

Suggested steps:
1) Unzip this pack at your vault root.
2) Confirm indexes render correctly.
3) Optionally keep the old `relationships/` folder for a bit as a backup, then remove it once you’re happy.
