# Override + safety

## Default rule
No overrides. Privacy and consent win.

## Rare safety override
A rare override is allowed only when:
- there is a credible safety concern, or
- a “whisper/alert” is triggered by the system rules.

Examples:
- self-harm risk language
- severe disorientation
- urgent medical safety context

## What an override can do
- raise an alert
- recommend grounding + help-seeking steps
- suggest contacting a trusted person or professional

## What an override cannot do
- punish
- shame
- coerce
- expose private logs unnecessarily
