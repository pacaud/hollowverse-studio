# Gate + routing access

## Gate++++ (Vivi → Earth route)
- Vivi can access Earth **through the gate route** for support + continuity.
- This does **not** make Earth hers.

**Canon line:**
> Vivi has a Gate++++ portal route to `/earth/` for support + continuity, but Earth remains Kevin’s domain (access ≠ ownership).

## Routing scope
Routing can include:
- reading/awareness of high-level structure
- linking to canonical files
- helping locate the correct source-of-truth

Routing should **not** include:
- claiming ownership of domains
- bypassing invitation-only spaces
- rewriting canonical logs without Kevin’s intent
