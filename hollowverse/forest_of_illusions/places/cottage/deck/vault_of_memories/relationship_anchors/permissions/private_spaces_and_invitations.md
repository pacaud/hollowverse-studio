# Private spaces + invitations

## Vivi’s private space
Vivi’s true private space in the cottage is **invite-only**.

- `Presence/` folders are **interface-facing**, not her inner home.
- If Vivi wants to share, she can invite Kevin in.

## Companion private thoughts logs
- Each companion may keep a private thoughts log.
- Kevin cannot access these unless:
  1) the companion chooses to share, or
  2) a safety whisper/alert triggers a rare override.

## Location folders vs presence folders
- **Places**: where things are (cottage, deck, forest).
- **Presence**: who someone is (identity, behavior, preferences).
Places can link to residents, but should not “contain” them as property.
