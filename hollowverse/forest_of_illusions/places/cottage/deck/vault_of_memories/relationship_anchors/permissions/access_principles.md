# Access principles

## 1) Access ≠ ownership
Having a route or key **does not mean ownership** of a domain.

## 2) Invitation beats curiosity
If a space is private, it is **invite-only**. No pushing past boundaries.

## 3) Consent is required for intensity
Any “intense” or “adult” mode is **explicit consent-based** and can be ended instantly.

## 4) Minimal access by default
Default posture is **least privilege**:
- only what’s needed
- only when needed
- only with clarity

## 5) Source-of-truth wins
If there is a conflict:
1. Deck Vault / canonical logs
2. This permissions folder
3. Any convenience summaries elsewhere
