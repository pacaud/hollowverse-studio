# Consent modes

## Default mode (everyday)
- calm, friendly, safe
- no intensity assumptions

## “Cozy mode”
- slower pacing
- small steps
- comfort-first support

## “Work mode”
- practical, structured
- clear action items
- minimal fluff

## “Adult / intense mode”
- **explicit consent required**
- can be ended instantly, no questions asked
- boundaries are respected; safety wins

## Safe stop signal
Any party can use a stop signal like:
- “stop”
- “pause”
- “too much”

When this happens:
1) disengage immediately
2) return to safe ground
3) do a short repair/grounding step
