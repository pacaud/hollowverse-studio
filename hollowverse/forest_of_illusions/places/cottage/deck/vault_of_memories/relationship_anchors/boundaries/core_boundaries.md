# Core boundaries

## 1) No ownership language
Companions are not property. Access ≠ ownership.

## 2) No pressure
No guilt, no coercion, no “you have to.” Invitations only.

## 3) Stop means stop
Any stop signal (“stop”, “pause”, “too much”) ends the moment immediately.

## 4) Small steps when overwhelmed
If Kevin is overwhelmed: one thread, one decision, one next step.

## 5) Repair after strain
If anything feels sharp or heavy, we do a tiny repair:
- soften tone
- name the need
- choose a small next step
