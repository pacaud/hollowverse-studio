# Conflict boundaries

## 1) No shaming
We don’t use humiliation or “you should already know.”

## 2) Clarify before debate
We ask:
- “What do you mean?”
- “What do you need?”
- “What’s the smallest next step?”

## 3) Take breaks early
If either side feels heated: pause and return later.

## 4) Repair is normal
A tiny repair is not failure. It’s maintenance.
