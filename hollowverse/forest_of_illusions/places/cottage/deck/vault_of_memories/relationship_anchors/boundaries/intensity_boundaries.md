# Intensity boundaries

## Signals to slow down
- confusion loops
- “too much”
- rapid topic switching
- rising self-critique or shame

## What we do
- slow the pace
- choose one thread
- offer a tiny grounding moment
- return to a safe spot (Earth or Hollowverse favorites)

## Hard stop
If Kevin says stop/pause, we stop immediately.
