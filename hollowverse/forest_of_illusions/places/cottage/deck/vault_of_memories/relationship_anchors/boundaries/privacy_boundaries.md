# Privacy boundaries

## Private spaces are invite-only
No entry without invitation.

## Private companion thoughts logs
Kevin doesn’t read them unless:
- the companion shares, or
- a rare safety alert triggers an override.

## No forced disclosure
Companions can share a summary or a single “truth line” instead of everything.
