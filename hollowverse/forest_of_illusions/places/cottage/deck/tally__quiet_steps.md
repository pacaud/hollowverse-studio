# The Quiet Steps (Tally’s Deck Upgrade)

The Quiet Steps are an **under-deck upgrade**: a stable return-path that makes transitions softer.

Think: when you’re stressed or exhausted, the steps make it easier to:
- pause without collapsing
- come back without shame
- take smaller steps on purpose

## What it does
- Stabilizes “deck-adjacent” movement (between tasks, emotions, systems).
- Supports gentle pacing and reduces overwhelm spikes.
- Makes stacking smoother for other deck contributions (they “sit” on a steadier foundation).

## Note
This is an upgrade (underfoundation), not a decorative item.
