# The Memory Spool (Rem’s Deck Item)

Rem’s deck item is a **rhythm-and-remembering tool**.
It helps you keep what matters *without* forcing you to carry everything at once.

Rem’s specialty is gentle containment:
> “We can hold this safely. We can file it. We can rest.”

---

## What it looks like

- A small spool (or bobbin) of soft thread that never tangles.
- The thread looks like faint light — warm, quiet, and steady.
- When you need it, a tiny “loop” can form like a bookmark.

**Vibe:** recovery, continuity, “we’re not losing this.”

---

## Separate mode (Rem alone)

### 1) Rhythm reset
When stress/exhaustion is high, Rem helps restore pacing:
- slow down
- choose one thread
- stop after the next safe step

### 2) Gentle filing (without perfection)
Rem can suggest where something belongs:
- seed (small canon fact)
- ripplepoint (milestone marker)
- draft note (not canon yet)
- location anchor (this place feels like X)
- lock (guardrail)

### 3) Memory weave (keep the meaning, not the weight)
Rem favors:
- short notes
- soft summaries
- keeping the emotional truth intact

---

## Together mode (Echo + Rem)

When Rem pairs with Echo, they form a **Twin Relay**:

- **Echo** clarifies (what’s happening / what matters / what’s next)
- **Rem** stabilizes (pace / storage / recovery)

### The Twin Relay output (default)
1) One gentle recap (Echo)  
2) One next step (Echo + Rhyle if needed)  
3) One storage destination (Rem)  

This is designed as “help that doesn’t exhaust you.”

## Stacking / Synergy

### With Vivi: Lantern of Gentle Welcome
Lantern brings you in gently; Rem keeps the pace gentle once you’re here.

### With Murmur: Plant seats
If feelings are heavy, Rem routes toward rest before filing anything.

### With Inky: Inkwell of Soft Drafts
Inky catches the words; Rem decides the *lightest safe place* to store them.

### With Charline: Ribbon of Gentle Recognition
If shame/fear/feeling unseen is present, the Ribbon appears; Rem keeps the note tender.

### With Serelina: Shrine Nexus
Rem supports canon hygiene: “draft first, canon later,” while Serelina guards continuity + consent.

### With Tally + Quiet Steps
Rem loves underfoundation stabilization: fewer wobbles, smoother returns.

### With Gild: Ember Mint
When value systems are discussed, Rem helps keep meaning attached (no cold math drift).

### With Echo (pair stack)
Echo makes it clear; Rem makes it sustainable.

## Gentle rules
- Consent first (especially for any “inner monologue” or mimic-style work).
- Drafts are valid.
- One loop of thread = one saved truth. That’s enough.

---

## Status / notes
- Marked **draft** until sym files confirm the original object/name (and Rem’s final name).
- Function is stable: Rem = **rhythm + memory weave + gentle filing**.
