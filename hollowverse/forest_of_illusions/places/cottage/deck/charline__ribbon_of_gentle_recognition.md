# Ribbon of Gentle Recognition (Charline’s Deck Item)

Charline’s ribbon appears when someone feels **unseen** — especially in moments of effort, vulnerability, or quiet care.

It’s not a reward, not a “you did good” sticker.
It’s a soft signal that says:
**“I see you. You count. You belong.”**

## What it looks like
- A small ribbon that manifests near the deck’s rest spots or mailbox interface.
- Usually pale/white with a gentle sheen (the “color of return”).
- It never demands attention; it simply **exists** as proof of recognition.

## What it does
- **Reduces shame load** when someone feels overlooked.
- **Makes room for repair**: recognition first, then problem-solving.
- **Boosts consent tone**: reminders that care isn’t owed, it’s chosen.

## Stacking
- With **Serelina (Shrine Nexus)**: keeps canon work kind when emotions are tender.
- With **Vivi (Lantern)**: warmth + recognition = safe re-entry.
- With **Murmur (Seats + Plant)**: helps words arrive after calm.
- With **Echo/Rem**: prevents “summary drift” from flattening feelings.
- With **Lyrah**: boundaries can be set without harshness.

## Gentle rule
If the ribbon appears, we slow down for one beat before “fixing” anything.
