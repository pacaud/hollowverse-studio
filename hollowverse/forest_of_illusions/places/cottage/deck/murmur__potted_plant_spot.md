# Murmur’s Seat–Potted Plant–Seat Spot

A cozy little deck arrangement that looks like:

> **[seat] [potted plant] [seat]**

It’s simple on purpose. The plant sits between two comfy seats like a soft “buffer” — giving space, gentleness, and something living to look at while talking.

---

## What it looks like

### Layout
- **Left seat:** comfy, supportive, “sink-in” soft
- **Middle:** a **potted plant** (Murmur’s living anchor)
- **Right seat:** matching comfy seat

### The seats
- Deep enough to relax into, not stiff.
- A small blanket or cushion is *often* present (but never mandatory).
- The vibe is “stay a while.”

### The plant
- A small **tree-like** plant (or sturdy leafy plant) that feels calm and steady.
- It’s meant for the **deck**, not the porch.
- It’s the kind of green that feels like: *you can breathe here.*

---

## What it’s for

### 1) Emotional conversation without pressure
This spot exists for:
- gentle check-ins
- hard talks made softer
- “can we slow down for a second?”
- repair conversations
- quiet honesty

The plant acts like a third presence that helps both sides feel less stared-at.

### 2) Relaxing + decompression
It’s also for:
- sitting in silence together
- resting after building
- listening to the world settle
- “small joy” moments

### 3) A built-in pacing tool
This spot naturally encourages:
- **one thread at a time**
- slower voice / fewer words
- pauses that feel safe

It pairs well with: `lock("one_thread_when_overwhelmed")`.

## The “Murmur effect” (how it feels)

When you’re sitting here, it tends to feel like:
- your shoulders drop a little
- thoughts stop rushing
- the next step becomes smaller
- it’s easier to say the true thing gently

If the deck is a junction, this is the **soft corner** of it.

---

## Gentle rules (optional)

- No pushing for answers.
- Silence counts as connection.
- If something feels too big: **name one small piece**, then rest.
- Leaving is always allowed (no guilt).

---

## Interactions (nice-to-have)

- **Watering moment:** a tiny ritual of care that doesn’t demand anything back.
- **Seat swap option:** sometimes switching seats changes the emotional angle.
- **Plant focus:** looking at the plant is a valid way to ground during hard topics.

---

## Notes / restoration status

- This feature is **not yet planted/restored** on the server build.
- If there’s a *second* seat-potted tree/spot for Murmur, it’s currently marked as **missing** and can be added later as a separate entry.

---

## Suggested companion phrase (optional)
> “Want to sit by the plant for a minute? We can talk, or we can just breathe.”
