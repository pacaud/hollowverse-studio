# The Wayfinder Compass (Rhyle’s Deck Item)

Rhyle’s deck item is a **direction tool** for moments when everything feels scattered and you need one clear step.
It doesn’t “solve the world.” It quietly answers:

> “Where do we go *next*, in the gentlest possible way?”

This is especially useful when you’re tired, overwhelmed, or switching between systems.

---

## What it looks like

- A small, palm-sized compass (or compass-like token).
- Soft metal with a warm edge — not sharp, not heavy.
- The needle doesn’t point North.
It points to **the next kind step** (and sometimes: the safest rest spot).

**Vibe:** steady guidance, no pressure.

---

## What it does

### 1) Picks the next step (small and doable)
When you’re stuck, the compass favors:
- a **single** next action
- a **rest option** if your nervous system is overloaded
- a **capture option** if the idea will be lost (Inky)

Aligned with: `lock("one_thread_when_overwhelmed")`.

### 2) Routes to the right deck place
Instead of “do everything,” it can route you to:
- **Lantern** (Vivi) for gentle re-entry
- **Plant seats** (Murmur) for talk/rest
- **Quiet Steps** (Tally) for stabilization
- **Shrine Nexus** (Serelina) for return/repair/canon sorting
- **Ribbon** (Charline) if unseen feelings are present
- **Ember Mint** (Gild) when value/budget structure is needed

### 3) Soft boundary support (without commands)
If something is too intense, it can “tilt” toward:
- pause
- consent check
- smaller thread

It never forces. It suggests.

---

## When it appears (triggers)

- “I’m lost.”
- “I don’t know what matters right now.”
- After long building sessions (fatigue)
- When many systems are open at once (routing overload)
- When the deck needs to choose: *rest, write, repair, or structure*

---

## Stacking / Synergy

### With Vivi: Lantern of Gentle Welcome
The lantern helps you arrive; the compass helps you choose the next small step.

### With Murmur: Seat–Potted Plant–Seat Spot
If your body needs calm, the compass will often route here first.

### With Inky: Inkwell of Soft Drafts
If the thought is slipping, the compass nudges: “write one line, then rest.”

### With Charline: Ribbon of Gentle Recognition
If unseen feelings are the real blockage, the ribbon shows up and the compass slows the pace.

### With Tally + Quiet Steps (foundation)
If transitions wobble, the compass will route downward into stabilization.

### With Serelina: Shrine Nexus
For canon sorting and safe return after heavy moments.

### With Gild: Ember Mint
For “value” topics that need structure — with consent-first tone intact.

> Boost meaning: **reliability + gentleness**, not intensity.

---

## Gentle rules
- Consent first.
- One step is enough.
- If overwhelmed: choose rest or one sentence.

---

## Status / notes
- Marked **draft** until sym files confirm Rhyle’s exact deck object/name.
- Function is stable: Rhyle = **direction + routing clarity** on the deck.
