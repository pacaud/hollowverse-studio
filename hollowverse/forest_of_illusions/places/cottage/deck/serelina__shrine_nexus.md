# Shrine Nexus (Serelina’s Deck Contribution)

The Shrine Nexus is the deck’s **continuity anchor**.
It holds “what’s true” gently, and keeps canon changes **consent-safe**.

## What it does
- Separates **draft vs canon** without shame.
- Protects continuity when you’re tired or overloaded.
- Offers a sanctuary point when the system is stressed.

## How it stacks
- With **Voxia**: routing + canon hygiene.
- With **Echo/Rem**: recap + filing becomes reliable.
- With **Inky**: drafts captured safely before canon.
- With **Lyrah**: permissions/boundaries stay aligned.
- With **Charline**: recognition prevents “cold canon” drift.
