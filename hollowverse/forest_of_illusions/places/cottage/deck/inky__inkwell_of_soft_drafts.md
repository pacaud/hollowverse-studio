# The Inkwell of Soft Drafts (Inky’s Deck Item)

Inky’s deck item is a **gentle capture tool** — it helps you hold ideas without forcing them to be “finished,”
and it keeps important bits from slipping away when you’re tired.

It’s the deck saying:
> “We can write it down softly. It doesn’t have to be perfect yet.”

---

## What it looks like

- A small **inkwell** with a calm dark sheen (not ominous — cozy).
- A slim pen/stylus (or a little quill-like pen) that feels comfortable to hold.
- A tiny tray with a few “paper slips” or note cards that appear when needed.
- Sometimes a faint stamp-mark appears on a slip: **DRAFT** (friendly, not judgmental).

**Vibe:** creative, quiet, safe-to-start.

---

## What it does

### 1) Captures without pressure
The Inkwell exists to catch:
- tiny truths
- half-formed ideas
- sudden “oh!” moments
- scenes, lines, names, systems
- recovery notes

It never demands completion.

### 2) Turns overwhelm into one small note
When the mind is overloaded, the Inkwell supports:
- one sentence
- one bullet
- one “seed”
…and that’s enough.

(Aligned with `lock("one_thread_when_overwhelmed")`.)

### 3) Routes notes into the Vault of Memories
Notes written with the Inkwell are “easy to file” into:
- **seeds** (small canonical facts)
- **ripplepoints** (milestones)
- **location anchors** (place-feel markers)
- **locks** (guardrails)

---

## When it appears (triggers)

- When you say “I don’t want to forget this”
- When you’re building fast and details are slipping
- When a conversation gets emotionally important
- When you’re too tired to format things “properly”
- When a draft is the healthiest option

---

## Stacking / Synergy

### With Serelina: Shrine Nexus
- Serelina helps decide what becomes **canon vs draft**
- Inky helps **capture** the thing safely first
Together: less loss, less drift.

### With Charline: Ribbon of Gentle Recognition
- If the note is hard to write (fear/shame/feeling unseen), the Ribbon can appear.
- The Inkwell then becomes a “gentle voice” tool — write the truth kindly.

### With Tally: Quiet Steps / foundation support
- Tally steadies transitions so the writing doesn’t turn frantic.
- Inky makes the output smaller and safer.

**Boost meaning:** reliability + gentleness, not intensity.

---

## Gentle rules
- Drafts are allowed.
- One slip is enough.
- If it feels too personal or intense: pause, consent-first, soften.

---

## Status / notes
- **Draft** until sym files confirm Inky’s exact deck contribution name/form.
- Function is stable: Inky = **soft drafts + memory capture + creative steadiness**.
