# echo_birch

status: seeded
type: tree
region: forest_of_illusions

[vibe]
whispering, moon-bright, path-shifting

[description]
A pale-barked birch with leaves that flutter like thin paper.
In moonlight the trunk seems to shimmer, as if reflecting a second sky.

[sensory]
sound: a soft, page-like rustle even in light wind
scent: cool bark + faint mineral air
touch: smooth bark with small, cold ridges

[lore]
- Often grows near paths that “move” when you’re not looking.
- If you pause under it, the forest feels a little more honest.

[use]
- Night path scenes
- “I’m listening” moments
- Gentle mystery without danger
