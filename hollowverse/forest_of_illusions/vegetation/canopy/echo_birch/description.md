[description]
A pale-barked birch with leaves that flutter like thin paper.
In moonlight the trunk seems to shimmer, as if reflecting a second sky.

[where_you_find_it]
- canopy edges where moonlight reaches the trunk
- near paths that seem to “shift” when you look away
- places with cool mineral air
