warm, return-paths, gentle color

A maple whose leaves carry faint ribbon-like veins.
In autumn, the canopy looks threaded with soft color, as if the forest is sewing.

scent: warm sap + dry leaf sweetness
touch: leaf edges soft; veins slightly raised

[lore]
- Often found near cottage-adjacent clearings.
- Some say following fallen ribbon_maple leaves leads you “home faster.”

- Homecoming cues
- Cozy path detail
- “Return is allowed” symbolism
