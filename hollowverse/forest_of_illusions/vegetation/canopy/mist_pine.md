# mist_pine

status: seeded
type: tree
region: forest_of_illusions

[vibe]
steady, quiet protection, fog-friendly

[description]
A tall pine with dark needles and a trunk that seems to drink fog.
It makes the air feel cleaner and calmer nearby.

[sensory]
sound: deep hush when wind passes through needles
scent: resin + clean cold air
touch: rough bark; needles soft but persistent

[lore]
- A good tree to rest under when the forest feels too loud.
- Fog gathers around it like a blanket, not a warning.

[use]
- Calm shelter scenes
- Fog ambience anchor
- “It’s okay to slow down” symbol
