[description]
A single bloom that seems to hold a small, warm light inside its petals.
It never shines harshly—more like candlelight seen through fabric.

[placement]
Often appears along safe-feeling return paths, near rest stones,
or at the edge of a clearing where someone finally stops running from themselves.
