[scene_hooks]
- A lantern bloom appears the first night someone returns “for real.”
- It grows beside a marker stone that was thought to be forgotten.
- Two people see it at once—and both think it was meant for the other.
- The glow reflects off a ribbon/pin/keepsake, surfacing a quiet truth.
- Someone reaches to pick it—and realizes their hand won’t close.
- A lantern bloom shows up after a long silence, not as reward—just as welcome.
- A path that felt unsafe turns gentle again when the bloom appears at the bend.
- The bloom lights a page in a notebook just enough to read one line.
- It appears where a promise was made long ago—and where it can be renewed safely.
- A guide whispers: “If you see it, you’re allowed to stop walking.”
