[scene_hooks]
- A starlumen_rose blooms after someone chooses rest instead of collapse.
- It appears at the exact place a panic spiral was interrupted with patience.
- Two travelers see it and both think it’s for the other.
- The shimmer highlights a ribbon/pin/keepsake and a quiet truth.
- Someone reaches for it and realizes their hand won’t close.
- A guide whispers: “It’s the forest saying thank you.”
- The rose appears beside an old marker stone that was thought forgotten.
- It blooms once, then fades before anyone can call someone else to see it.
