[description]
A rose-like bloom with petal edges that catch light like fine dust.
In darkness it doesn’t glow brightly—it shimmers,
like moonlight on calm water.

[where_it_appears]
Often found where someone pauses instead of pushing through—
a clearing edge, a rest stone, or the quiet side of a path.
