[vibe]
warm, gentle guidance, quiet blessing

[description]
A single bloom that seems to hold a small, warm light inside its petals.
It never shines harshly—more like candlelight seen through fabric.

[sensory]
scent: warm tea steam + clean night air
light: soft inner glow; strongest at dusk and night
sound: none, but the area feels calmer

[lore]
- Appears when someone is returning after a hard stretch, or choosing care over collapse.
- The forest’s way of saying: “You’re allowed to come home gently.”
- It does not “fix” anything. It simply marks that you made it through.

[use]
- Restoration milestones
- Homecoming scenes
- Quiet vow moments

[rules]
- Never harvested
- Never owned
- If seen: acknowledge, breathe, and leave it as you found it
