[vibe]
blessing, return, gentle awe

[description]
A full peony-like bloom that holds a warm light in its center,
as if a tiny lantern is hidden inside the petals.

[sensory]
scent: rich and comforting, like warm tea steam
visual: soft inner glow; never harsh

[lore]
- Appears only when someone is returning after a long absence,
  or when the forest is quietly “welcoming you back.”
- Never picked. Never owned.

[use]
- Restoration milestones
- Homecoming scenes
- “The forest sees you” moment

[rules]
- Rare appearance
- No harvesting
- If seen, it’s a gift—let it pass
