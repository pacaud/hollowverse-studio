region: forest_of_illusions
bloom_time: rare, only when the forest is blessing a gentle return

[vibe]
soft awe, gratitude, luminous calm

[description]
A rose-like bloom with petal edges that catch light like fine dust.
In darkness it doesn’t glow brightly—it *shimmers*, like moonlight on calm water.

[sensory]
scent: warm tea steam + faint wild honey
visual: subtle shimmer; strongest at night or candlelight
touch: velvety petals, thornless stem (always)

[lore]
- A legendary “thank you” from the forest.
- Appears when someone chooses patience over panic, or rest over collapse.
- Never appears to be taken—only to be witnessed.

[use]
- “We made it” moments
- Closure scenes
- Gentle milestone marker

[rules]
- Never picked
- Never owned
- If seen, speak softly or not at all
