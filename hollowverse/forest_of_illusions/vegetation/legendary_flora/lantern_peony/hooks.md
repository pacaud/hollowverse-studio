[scene_hooks]
- A lantern_peony blooms the first night someone returns “for real.”
- It appears beside a path-marker that was thought to be forgotten.
- Two people see it at once—and both feel like it was meant for the other.
- The glow reflects off a ribbon/pin/keepsake, highlighting a quiet truth.
- Someone tries to pick it…and realizes their hand won’t close.
- The bloom shows up where a promise was made long ago.
- It appears after a long silence, not as reward—just as welcome.
- A guide says: “If you see it, you’re allowed to stop walking.”
