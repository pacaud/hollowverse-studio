- Someone chooses patience over panic—starshade_morel appears the next night.
- A mentor points and whispers: “That’s the forest saying you did the gentle thing.”
- The morel shows up near a vow, but only if the vow is spoken softly.
- Two friends spot it at once and both stop arguing.
- The flecks are absent tonight—someone is rushing through a choice.
- It appears beside a warmstone rest, like a quiet “you’re safe.”
- A companion notices it first, and the whole scene slows down.
- Someone reaches to pick it… and realizes their hand won’t close.
