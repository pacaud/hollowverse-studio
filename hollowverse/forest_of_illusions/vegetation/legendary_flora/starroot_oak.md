[vibe]
ancient, gentle authority, quiet truth

[description]
A broad oak with bark like dark velvet and faint starlike flecks in the grooves.
Its roots are rumored to glow softly under soil, like a hidden constellation.

[sensory]
sound: the space around it feels “still,” as if the forest is holding its breath
scent: deep earth + old wood + something clean and bright
touch: bark is warm-cool at once, strangely comforting

[lore]
- Said to appear when the forest needs to anchor a truth without forcing it.
- Standing beneath it can make tangled thoughts feel simpler.
- It does not “grant wishes.” It grants *clarity*.

[use]
- Major restoration milestones
- Vow moments
- “We’re safe enough to be honest” scenes

[rules]
- Rare appearance (do not summon)
- No harvesting, carving, or claiming
- If you find it: sit, breathe, then leave it as you found it
