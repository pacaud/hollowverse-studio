[scene_hooks]
- A fog-heavy morning makes the berries look freshly dusted, like the forest repainted them overnight.
- A traveler follows mistblue patches to find a mist_pine grove without getting lost.
- A calm trail uses mistblue as a “slow here” signal instead of signs.
- Someone tastes a berry and realizes the flavor is more memory than sweetness.
- A rare silverdust patch appears near a bend that feels like a return point.
