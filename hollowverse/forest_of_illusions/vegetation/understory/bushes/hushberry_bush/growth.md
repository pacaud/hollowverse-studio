[growth_cycle]
- leafing
  - new leaves appear during the first stretch of cool, wet mornings
- blossom
  - tiny pale blooms, easy to miss (usually tucked under leaves)
- berry_set
  - a few berries form per branch; clusters stay small
- ripe
  - berries darken to near blue-black in shade
- dormancy
  - leaves thin out; the bush looks "tidier" rather than bare

[preferred_conditions]
- dappled shade
- mossy soil with steady moisture
- low wind (sheltered paths / quiet clearings)

[notes]
Because it’s rumor-tier, growth timing is still unconfirmed.
