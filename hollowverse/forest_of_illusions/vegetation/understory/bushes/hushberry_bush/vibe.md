- quiet
- careful
- inward
- soft caution
- "lower your voice"

[emotional_tone]
Hushberry feels like a private thought you decide not to say out loud.
Not sad—just gentle and contained.

[tempo]
- noticed: when you spot the berries in shade
- peak: steady, subtle
- fade: slow; leaves a "softened" after-feel

[limits]
It doesn’t force calm. It only invites it.
