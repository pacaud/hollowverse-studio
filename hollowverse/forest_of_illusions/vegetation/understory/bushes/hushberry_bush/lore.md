[the_rumor]
Hushberry is said to quiet anxious thoughts for a brief window—
not by erasing them, but by turning the volume down.

[why_it_stays_rumor]
No one has brought a whole branch back. They only return with stories,
and the stories never line up perfectly.

[trail_saying]
"If you find hushberry, you were already ready to slow down."

[omens]
- berries appearing near a bench: a rest is being offered
- berries missing from a known bush: someone came here to calm down
