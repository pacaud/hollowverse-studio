[baseline]
Tiny oak sprout; one leaf may show a faint star-fleck.

[whispered_variants]
- double-fleck
  - two tiny star specks on the same leaf (extremely rare)
- moon-vein
  - pale vein pattern that looks like a crescent (seen near still water)

[rarity]
All variants are “special scene” sightings, not defaults.
