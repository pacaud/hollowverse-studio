[appearance_window]
- turning points only (returns, vows, restorations, gentle truths becoming real)

[stages]
- emberbud
  - barely visible sprout; feels like “a thought that finally landed”
- starleaf
  - the star-fleck may appear on a single leaf
- softfade
  - it vanishes before it can be measured or moved

[notes]
Not cultivated. Not propagated. It arrives when the forest permits it.
