- It appears the first time someone tells the truth without fear.
- Two people see it, and both assume it’s “for the other.”
- A vow is spoken quietly—and the star-fleck shows for a single breath.
- Someone returns after a long absence and finds the sprout in the exact place they stopped last time.
- It appears near a warmstone bench, turning a rest into a moment.
- A character tries to mark the spot; the next day it’s somewhere else.
- The sprout shows up after an apology that doesn’t ask for forgiveness—only honesty.
