[visual]
- a tiny oak sprout
- one leaf may show a faint star-fleck (only at the right angle)
- looks “new” even in old moss

[scent]
- clean green + damp earth
- a faint “cold air” note in the morning

[touch]
- delicate stem; do not handle
- leaf feels like ordinary oak, just… quieter

[notes]
One-line pull: “a tiny oak sprout with a shy star-fleck on one leaf.”
