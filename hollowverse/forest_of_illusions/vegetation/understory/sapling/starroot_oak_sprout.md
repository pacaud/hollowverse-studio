[vibe]
rare clarity, quiet blessing

[description]
A tiny oak sprout with a leaf that sometimes shows a faint starlike fleck.
It is never found twice in the same place.

[lore]
- A “hint” of the starroot_oak, not a replacement.
- Appears when a truth is ready to take root gently.

[use]
- Milestone scenes
- Quiet vow moments

[rules]
- Never moved
- Never owned
- Witness only
