[scent]
- dry leaves + clean bark
- slightly stronger after light rain

[sound]
- nearby footsteps soften (like moss under boots)
- wind noise becomes less sharp along its edge

[touch]
- leaves: matte, cool, and smooth (not waxy)
- branches: flexible, springy, not scratchy

[visual]
- leaves absorb light a little; looks "quieter" than surrounding green
- forms tidy, compact shapes that imply a boundary without fencing
