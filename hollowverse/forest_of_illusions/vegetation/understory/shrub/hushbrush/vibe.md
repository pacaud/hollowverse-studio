[vibe_keywords]
- quiet boundary
- protective calm
- privacy without isolation
- "not right now" kindness

[emotional_tone]
Hushbrush feels like a soft curtain you can choose to draw.
It signals rest, not exclusion.

[tempo]
- onset: immediate (the moment you step near it)
- peak: steady, background
- fade: gentle; the calm lingers after you leave

[compatibility]
- pairs well with: warmstone rests, fog mornings, low lantern light
- works best near: rest spaces, benches, tucked-away paths

[limits]
- not a barrier plant
- more atmosphere + boundary cue than defense
