[lore]
- Grows near safe, sheltered hollows.
- Feels like the forest left a nightlight.

[trail_lore]
Old walkers call it a “kindness fern.”
If you spot it, you’re near a place where the forest expects you to slow down.

[omens]
- beads shimmering early: the evening will be gentle
- beads dull and dry: the hollow needs water (or the place has been too loud)
