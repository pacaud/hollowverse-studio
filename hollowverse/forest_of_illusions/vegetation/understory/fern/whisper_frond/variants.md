[known_variants]
- silverwhisper
  - look: underside flashes pale-silver when turned; edges seem sharper in moonlight
  - where: under mist_pine shade, near stone markers and still clearings
  - note: still quiet—just more reflective

- mistthread
  - look: extra-fine fronds; at distance it reads like a soft blur instead of leaves
  - where: heavy-fog trails, creek bends, and low mist pockets
  - note: easiest to miss until you stop walking

- rainhush
  - look: deeper green; holds droplets longer along the veins
  - where: post-rain understory, especially near moss beds and warmstone benches
  - note: scent gets stronger (wet greens)
