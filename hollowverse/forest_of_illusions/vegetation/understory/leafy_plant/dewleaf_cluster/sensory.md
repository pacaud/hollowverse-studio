[visual]
- dew beads cling to the leaves at dawn like tiny glass dots
- sparkle is strongest in first light, then fades into normal green

[scent]
- very light “clean leaf” scent
- strongest when the ground is cool and damp

[touch]
- leaves: soft, thin, slightly cool
- dew: cold beads that roll rather than soak

[sound]
- none; the quiet comes from noticing it
