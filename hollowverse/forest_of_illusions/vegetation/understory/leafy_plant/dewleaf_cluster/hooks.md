[scene_hooks]
- Someone follows dew-sparkle patches to find a stream before sunrise.
- A character realizes they’re rushing when the dew is already gone.
- Two people arrive at the same cluster—one early, one late—and feel the difference.
- Dew beads form a subtle line, like the forest is hinting “this way.”
- A quiet apology is spoken while dew still clings, then the day swallows it.
- The dew turns faintly silver for one morning—something is about to return.
