[scene_hooks]
- A character finds their reflection in a leaf-bowl and notices something missing.
- A rainstorm ends, but the bowls stay full—like the forest saved the last drops.
- Someone follows a line of bowl-leaves to a hidden bench under canopy.
- A message is left inside a leaf-bowl, weighted with a pebble.
- The bowls overflow in perfect rhythm, like a soft metronome for breathing.
- A creature drinks from the bowls without disturbing the surface.
