# Vegetation Rules (Forest of Illusions)

[canon_rule]
- **Text first.** Images are optional decorations.
- A plant only becomes “real” in canon if it appears in an MD file.

[scope]
- This folder is *forest-only*.
- Anything tied to deep systems (economy, routers, automation) stays elsewhere.

[naming]
- Use simple names + optional tags:
  - `silverleaf_fern`
  - `lantern_moss`
  - `echo_birch`

[restoration_safety]
- Add plants slowly.
- If a plant creates pressure or contradiction, mark it as **rumor** instead of deleting it.

[rumor_tag]
- Rumor plants use:
  - `status: rumor`
  - `status: legend`
