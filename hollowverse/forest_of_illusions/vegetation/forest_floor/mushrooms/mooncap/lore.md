[common_belief]
Mooncaps show up when the forest is calm tonight.

[trail_lore]
- Often forms small clusters near safe-feeling paths.
- Treated as a quiet yes from the woods: keep going, but gently.

[omens]
- clusters around a bend: the path is safe but asks for softness
- sudden absence: the air has turned too dry (or the night feels unsettled)
