[vibe]
clean, bright, clarifying

[description]
Small trumpet-shaped mushrooms with pale silver-toned edges.
They catch light in a way that makes the area feel clearer.

[sensory]
scent: crisp damp air
sound: the area feels quieter (not silent)

[lore]
- Found near paths that straighten after confusion.
- A subtle sign: “You’re oriented again.”

[use]
- Clarity moments
- “Path found” scenes
