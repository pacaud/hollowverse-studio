[common_belief]
Fogbuttons appear where the forest wants travelers to move gently.
Not to scare them—just to soften the day.

[trail_lore]
Old walkers say:
“If fogbuttons show, the path is listening.”
Meaning: don’t stomp, don’t shout, and don’t rush grief through the trees.

[creature_whisper]
Some claim small foxes avoid stepping on fogbuttons,
threading their paws through the moss as if the buttons are tiny boundary stones.

[omens]
- fogbuttons in a straight line: a safe route through low visibility
- fogbuttons around a bench: a rest spot meant to be found
- fogbuttons disappearing early: the air is turning too dry (or the place is too loud)
