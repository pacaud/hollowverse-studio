[emotional_tone]
Fogbutton is the feeling of lowering your voice without being told.
It doesn’t demand silence—it invites softness.

[tempo]
- onset: immediate (noticed the moment you see it in fog)
- peak: steady, calm, background
- fade: slow; lingers as “quiet attention”

[compatibility]
- pairs well with: aurora mist, moss beds, warmstone rests
- works best near: foggy trails, shaded clearings, stream edges

[limits]
- not dramatic magic
- more mood-marker than effect
