# inkveil — lore

type: lore_profile
parent: inkveil
region: forest_of_illusions

[common_belief]
Inkveil grows near things the forest “doesn’t explain” right away.

[meaning]
A reminder: mystery can be safe.
You’re allowed to take time, to look twice, to learn slowly.

[trail_whisper]
Old walkers say inkveil shows up when a path is trying to teach patience:
not to test you—just to keep you from missing something gentle.

[omens]
- inkveil in a small cluster: slow down; the next bend matters
- inkveil beside stone: something hidden is nearby, but not hostile
- inkveil gone overnight: the air dried too fast (or the place got too rushed)
