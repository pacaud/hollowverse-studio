# Mushrooms

## mooncap
status: seeded  
vibe: pale caps, faint glow in darkness  
notes:
- Not bright — more like a soft reflection.
- Often forms little rings that feel “safe to step around.”

## ember_gill
status: seeded  
vibe: rusty-orange gills under darker caps  
notes:
- Shows up near old fallen logs.
- The color feels like a tiny hearth ember.

## glassspore (optional)
status: legend  
vibe: translucent, fragile-looking  
notes:
- Appears only when the forest wants to be *seen clearly*.
