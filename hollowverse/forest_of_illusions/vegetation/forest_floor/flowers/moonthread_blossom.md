[vibe]
tender, dreamy, slow time

[description]
Small blossoms connected by fine, thread-like stems that glint under moonlight.
From a distance it looks like someone stitched light into the grass.

[sensory]
scent: faint vanilla-cool
visual: glimmers softly, never bright

[lore]
- Appears when the forest wants you to rest without retreating.
- Often near the cottage-return route.

[use]
- Night walking scenes
- Gentle “come back” cue
- Calm magic ambience
