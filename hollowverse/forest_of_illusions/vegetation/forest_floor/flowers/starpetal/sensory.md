- clusters read like “stars on the ground” in low light
- easiest to notice at late afternoon and dusk

[scent]
- light, clean, slightly sweet
- strongest when the air cools toward evening

[touch]
- petals: delicate, but not fragile
- stem: flexible; bends more than it breaks

[sound]
- none; they’re quiet the way soft grass is quiet
