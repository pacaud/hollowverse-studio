[emotional_tone]
Starpetal feels like the forest leaving a soft note on the ground: not a demand, not a test—just warmth.

[tempo]
- onset: immediate (noticed at a glance)
- peak: steady, background comfort
- fade: slow; the feeling lingers after you pass

[compatibility]
- pairs well with: return paths, warmstone rests, late-day lantern light
- works best near: cottage-adjacent clearings and quiet bends

[limits]
- not intense, not sacred
- meant to be familiar, not dramatic
