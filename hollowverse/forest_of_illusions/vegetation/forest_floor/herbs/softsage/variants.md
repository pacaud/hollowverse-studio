[baseline]
Softsage is normally pale green with a faint silver cast, low to the ground,
and most common near cool shade and quiet paths.

[known_variants]
- moonsoft softsage
  - look: stronger silver tone; leaves seem to “hold” moonlight
  - where: deeper shade, near still water or stone rests
  - note: rarer, but not magical-overpowered—just more luminous

- mistkissed softsage
  - look: slightly darker leaf with tiny dew-bead patterning
  - where: trails that see frequent aurora mist
  - note: grows in clusters, often near benches or markers

- sunflattened softsage
  - look: paler, less silver; leaves look quieter and more matte
  - where: edges of clearings with too much direct light
  - note: more common than people think; often overlooked

- pageleaf (old cultivar)
  - look: thinner leaves; less fuzz; sharper herbal scent
  - where: near old study-nooks, abandoned paths, forgotten notebooks
  - note: considered “older” softsage—still the same plant line
