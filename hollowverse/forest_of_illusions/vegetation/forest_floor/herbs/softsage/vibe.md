[vibe_keywords]
- clear
- gentle focus
- quiet order
- settled breath
- “room to think”

[emotional_effect]
Softsage doesn’t force clarity—it makes space for it.
It helps the mind feel less crowded, like a desk being gently cleared.

[tempo]
- onset: subtle (2–5 minutes with touch or scent)
- peak: steady, not sharp
- fade: slow, leaves a “tidy” after-feel

[rituals]
- rub a leaf between fingers before deciding
- place a small sprig near a notebook or lantern
- mark a quiet trail by planting softsage near stones or benches

[compatibility]
- pairs well with: aurora mist, cool shade, warm stone rests
- works best near: study paths, sheltered clearings, calm rest spots

[limits]
- not a stimulant
- doesn’t override panic; if someone is overwhelmed, pair with warmth + grounding first
