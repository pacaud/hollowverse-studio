status: seeded
type: sensory_profile
parent: softsage
region: forest_of_illusions

[scent]
- baseline: dry-herbal, clean
- close_read: “paper-calm” herbal note, not sweet
- strongest: youngleaf → early mature
- fades: late mature (still present, softer)

[touch]
- leaf: velvety; soft drag against the fingertip
- stem: thin and flexible (never stiff)
- moisture: holds mist droplets without feeling wet

[sound]
- none on its own; the “sound” is more the quiet you notice around it
- in wind: a soft brush movement (subtle, not rustling)

[visual_cues]
- cool shade: faint silver cast shows up strongest
- sun: color flattens and looks quieter
- mist: beads lightly, looks “softened” instead of glossy
