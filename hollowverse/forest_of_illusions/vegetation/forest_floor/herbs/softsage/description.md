[appearance]
Softsage looks designed to be touched.
Its leaves have a gentle fuzz—more “warm cloth” than “plant hair.”
In cool shade, the silver tone shows up like moonlight on paper.
In sun, it goes quieter and flatter.

[how_it_moves]
A small breeze makes it shift in a slow sway.
In mist, the leaves catch tiny droplets and hold them without looking wet.
