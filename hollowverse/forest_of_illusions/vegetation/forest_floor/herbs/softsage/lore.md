[what_people_believe]
Softsage is said to grow where thoughts have been repeated enough times
to “wear a path” through the air. Not big emotions—just steady ones.

[origin_whisper]
Some say it began as an herb planted beside a warm stone rest,
meant for someone who kept trying to decide—and never could.
The herb didn’t choose for them.
It simply stayed, gentle and present, until the choice became possible.

[trail_lore]
Quiet trails sometimes use softsage instead of signs.
If you find it in small patches near stones, it usually means:
- this route is safe
- this place is meant for rest
- keep your voice low (not as a rule, more as a kindness)

[forest_behavior_myth]
In aurora mist, softsage is rumored to “lean” slightly toward the nearest bench
or sheltered marker. Not enough to notice unless you’re already looking.

[companions_and_creatures]
- A few travelers claim pale foxes pace the edges of softsage patches,
  as if checking the trail is still calm.
- Small birds sometimes steal a single leaf and drop it near notebooks,
  like they’re returning something borrowed.

[omens]
- If softsage grows in a perfect ring: someone is circling the same thought.
- If it sprouts beside a door or threshold: a gentle decision is coming.
- If it dries too fast: the place has become too loud or too rushed.

[lore_hooks]
- A quiet bench becomes famous because softsage never fails to grow there.
- A missing notebook is found because a softsage trail “marks” the way back.
- Someone plants softsage on purpose to create a calm path through a tense area.
