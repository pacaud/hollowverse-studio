# night_moth — sensory

status: seeded
type: sensory_profile
parent: night_moth
region: forest_of_illusions

[visual]
- wings: velvety, with a soft moon-catch sheen (never glittery)
- motion: slow drifting arcs, then sudden stillness on landing

[sound]
- near-silent wingbeat
- a faint “dusty hush” if it brushes moss or fern

[touch]
- wings: powder-soft (do not handle; the dust is protective)
- body: warm only if resting on a warmed stone

[notes]
If the forest feels loud, you usually won’t see night_moths—harsh energy keeps them away.
