[visual]
- sometimes a small pool with still water
- sometimes a smooth stone circle with the *idea* of water in the center
- reflections can feel “emotional” (never flashy)

[sound]
- near-silent; the loudest thing is your own breathing

[air]
- cool, clean, and a little “cleared” (like after rain)

[touch]
- stone rim feels smooth and slightly warm
- water (if present) feels calm, not cold-shocking
