[scene_hooks]
- Someone finds the clearing without meaning to—and finally stops rushing.
- The fog parts just enough to reveal a bench that wasn’t there yesterday.
- Two travelers arrive from different paths at the same time, both sure they were alone.
- A missing ribbon/pin is found in moss, placed neatly like it was kept safe.
- The clearing feels loud one day—something changed upstream.
- Fogbutton dots form a loose arrow, pointing toward a gentler route.
- A character practices saying one hard sentence here, where the air won’t “echo” it back.
- A guide calls it “the soft reset” and refuses to explain more.
