[vibe]
soft hush, slow pacing, fog-held calm

[description]
A clearing that tends to collect fog like a blanket.
Even in daylight, it feels muted and gentle.

[ground]
- mossy patches
- fogbutton mushrooms scattered like dots
- whisper_frond at the edges

[nearby]
- mist_pine saplings
- mistblue_bush in the shaded corners

[behavior]
- reliable: mostly
- illusion_level: low-medium (fog shifts perception, never traps)
- safety: high

[use]
- reset walks
- quiet scenes where words aren’t required
