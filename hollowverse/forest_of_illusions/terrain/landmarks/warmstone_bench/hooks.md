- Someone sits “for one minute” and realizes they’ve been carrying too much.
- A conversation that was hard indoors becomes easy on the warm stone.
- A small animal leaves a gift beside the bench, as if paying rent for safety.
- The bench is warm even on a cool day—someone important is returning.
- Two people arrive separately, then notice they both chose the same pause.
- A note is tucked under the bench edge: “If you’re here, breathe first.”
- After a storm, the bench dries faster than anything nearby.
- The cottage_return_path feels wrong until the bench is found again.
