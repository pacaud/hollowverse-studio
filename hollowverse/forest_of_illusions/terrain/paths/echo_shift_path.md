[vibe]
soft mystery, careful curiosity, safe uncertainty

[description]
A narrow path that sometimes seems to take one extra turn when you’re distracted.
It’s not dangerous—just… a little strange. Like the forest is asking you to look closer.

[markers]
- echo_birch saplings appear near the edges
- mooncap clusters show up at night
- whisper_frond grows where it narrows

[behavior]
- reliable: medium
- shifts: yes (minor reroutes, never trapping)
- safety: medium-high (stay calm, walk slowly)

[use]
- discovery scenes
- “the forest is listening” moments

[rule]
If you feel overwhelmed: stop, breathe, and turn back. The path will allow it.
