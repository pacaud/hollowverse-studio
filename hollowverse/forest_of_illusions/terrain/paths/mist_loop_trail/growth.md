# mist_loop_trail — growth

status: seeded
type: path_cycle
parent: mist_loop_trail
region: forest_of_illusions

[behavior]
- reliable: mostly
- shifts: light (the loop feels longer/shorter depending on mood)
- safety: high

[cycle_states]
- dawn
  - dewleaf_cluster tends to sparkle along the moss edges
- fog_morning
  - the loop feels softer and slightly “longer” (more turns revealed)
- clear_day
  - the loop feels shorter and more direct
- dusk
  - mist_pine pockets darken early; lantern-light reads warmer here

[notes]
The “shifts” are subtle and are treated as mood-alignment, not teleporting terrain.
