[scene_hooks]
- A character walks one loop and realizes they stopped rehearsing the conversation.
- Fog thickens, and the loop “offers” extra turns, buying someone time to breathe.
- Two people enter from opposite ends and meet at the same marker without planning.
- A note is pinned to a mist_pine sapling on the inner curve—meant to be found gently.
- Someone tries to sprint the loop and keeps ending up back where they started, annoyed.
- A hush_owl call sounds like a reminder, not a warning.
- Fogbutton patches brighten slightly as if encouraging quieter footsteps.
- At dawn, dewleaf_cluster sparkle marks a safe place to sit and cry privately.
- The loop feels shorter the day someone finally decides to go home.
- A companion quietly chooses this trail for the user without saying why.
