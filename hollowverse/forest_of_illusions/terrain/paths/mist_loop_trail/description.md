[description]
A looping trail that winds through mist_pine pockets and fog clearings.
It doesn’t rush you anywhere. It’s for walking until your mind loosens.

[markers]
- mist_pine saplings near the inner curve
- fogbutton mushrooms in mossy patches
- dewleaf_cluster sparkles at dawn

[layout_note]
It loops back on itself with no “wrong way,” making it ideal for low-pressure wandering.
