- it never traps; it always allows return

[triggers]
- distraction (thinking, arguing, rushing)
- curiosity (stopping to look closely)
- low visibility (mist, dusk)

[stability]
- reliable: medium
- shifts: yes (minor reroutes, never trapping)
- safety: medium-high (stay calm, walk slowly)

- mooncap clusters show up at night
