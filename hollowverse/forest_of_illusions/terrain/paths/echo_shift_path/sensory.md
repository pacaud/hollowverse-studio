# echo_shift_path — sensory

status: seeded
type: sensory_profile
parent: echo_shift_path
region: forest_of_illusions

[visual]
- the same path… until it isn’t (one extra bend, a shifted angle)
- edges feel slightly “softer” where it reroutes

[sound]
- quieter than nearby trails
- footfalls feel dampened, like the forest is listening

[air]
- cool and steady
- sometimes a faint “after-rain” clarity even when it hasn’t rained

[notes]
This path is meant to feel safe-uncertain, not dangerous.
