[vibe]
quiet wandering, slow reset, fog-soft

[description]
A looping trail that winds through mist_pine pockets and fog clearings.
It doesn’t rush you anywhere. It’s for walking until your mind loosens.

[markers]
- mist_pine saplings near the inner curve
- fogbutton mushrooms in mossy patches
- dewleaf_cluster sparkles at dawn

[behavior]
- reliable: mostly
- shifts: light (the loop feels longer/shorter depending on mood)
- safety: high

[use]
- reset walks
- gentle “processing without processing”
