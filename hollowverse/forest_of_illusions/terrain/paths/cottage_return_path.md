[vibe]
homecoming, steady, comforting

[description]
A well-worn path that gently bends toward the cottage.
It feels easier to walk when you’re tired, as if it “meets you halfway.”

[markers]
- ribbonred_bush appears along stretches of the route
- ribbon_maple leaves sometimes collect near turns
- the air smells warmer as you get closer

[behavior]
- reliable: yes
- shifts: minimal (only gentle bends, never tricks)
- safety: high

[use]
- return scenes
- “we’re okay” pacing
