[scene_hooks]
- A plan that felt impossible suddenly feels doable under this sky.
- Someone recognizes a path because the light “goes quiet” in a familiar way.
- A rare mossmute overcast settles in—everything gets so calm it feels unreal.
- A note left on a stump_table_circle doesn’t blow away because the wind stays gentle.
- Two people talk for the first time because the day feels safe enough to try.
- The sky stays dappled over one clearing only—like the forest is protecting it.
