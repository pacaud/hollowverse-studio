# echo_thunder

status: rumor
type: weather
region: forest_of_illusions

[vibe]
distant power, respectful caution

[description]
A far-off thunder that never seems to arrive as a real storm.
It’s more like the sound of weather happening somewhere else.

[effects_on_places]
- echo_shift_path feels more mysterious
- fogquiet_clearing becomes extra quiet
- mirrorpool_marker (if present) may vanish

[rules]
- no destructive storm follows
- if it feels too intense, it fades quickly

[use]
- tension release scenes
- “something is changing” tone

[notes]
Kept as rumor until it’s used safely in canon.
