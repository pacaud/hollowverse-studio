[emotional_tone]
Fog Blanket isn’t threatening. It’s the forest lowering the volume.
Steps get quieter, thoughts get slower, and the world feels closer.

[tempo]
- onset: gradual (air thickens first, then visibility shortens)
- peak: steady, even
- fade: slow; clears in soft layers

[limits]
- not a scare-fog
- meant for calm scenes, not danger scenes
