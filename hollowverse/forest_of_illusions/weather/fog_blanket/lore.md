[common_belief]
Fog Blanket appears when the forest wants the day to move gently.

[trail_lore]
Old walkers say: “If the fog lays down, you can set your hurry down too.”
It’s treated less like weather and more like permission.

[omens]
- fog gathers near a bench: a rest spot meant to be found
- fog repeats three mornings in a row: someone is processing something quietly
- fog refuses to settle: the place is too loud, too rushed, or too dry
