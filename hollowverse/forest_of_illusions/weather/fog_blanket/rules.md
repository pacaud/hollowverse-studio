# fog_blanket — rules

status: seeded
type: rules
parent: fog_blanket
region: forest_of_illusions

[scene_rules]
- This is a calm fog, not a threat fog.
- If you want danger, use a different weather state (do not “force” Fog Blanket into a chase).

[environment_rules]
- strong dry wind breaks it quickly
- deep shade and stream bends help it settle

[guidance]
Fog Blanket is permission to slow down.
Treat it like the forest lowering the volume, not hiding something.
