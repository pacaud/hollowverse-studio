- Someone takes the mist_loop_trail as a “reset walk” and comes back different.
- A quiet clearing feels like a private room outdoors—two people finally talk there.
- A lantern halo reveals a hidden sign only in fog.
- Mist_fox appears at a respectful distance, as if escorting a traveler through low visibility.
- A familiar stream sounds closer than it should, guiding someone home.
- Fog lifts in layers, uncovering something that wasn’t there yesterday.
- A too-loud group passes through; the next morning, the fog refuses to settle.
- A letter is found damp-but-safe under a stone during Fog Blanket.
