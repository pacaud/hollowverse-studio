## quick
Fog gathers low and steady, like a blanket laid across the forest floor.
Visibility shortens, but the mood becomes softer, not scarier.

## vibe
Hush. Slow pacing. Held.
Fog Blanket feels like the forest lowering the volume.

## sensory
- Visual: low steady fog, softened edges, warmer lantern halos
- Scent: cool damp air, moss, wet bark
- Sound: far sounds feel nearer, voices carry less
- Touch: light cool mist, not soaking

## cycle
- gather → settle → drift → lift
Typical duration: 1–8 hours, with a lingering hush-haze in shade.

## effects
- Places: mist_loop_trail reset-walk, fogquiet_clearing private-room feel, cottage_stream sounds closer
- Fauna: mist_fox at distance, night_moth more noticeable near dusk

## use
Grounding, reset walks, “let’s go slower” scenes.

## lore
Old walkers say: “If the fog lays down, you can set your hurry down too.”
