[scene_hooks]
- A path becomes “simple” for one night, and someone finally makes it home.
- Aurora Mist arrives after a long silence—not as reward, as welcome.
- Two travelers see different colors, like it’s reflecting what they need.
- A legendary bloom is glimpsed through the ribbons and then gone.
- The forest feels aligned just long enough to untangle a hard decision.
- Someone tries to chase it and realizes it can’t be held.
