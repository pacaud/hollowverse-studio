# clear_daylight — rules

status: seeded
type: rules
parent: clear_daylight
region: forest_of_illusions

[rules]
- no harsh glare (even at noon, it stays soft)
- if the forest is in recovery mode, this weather is more likely
- pairs poorly with loud rush: it tends to slip into overcast if the pace stays too sharp
