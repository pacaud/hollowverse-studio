[scene_hooks]
- A hard conversation becomes possible because the day feels “simple.”
- Someone notices the path is shorter—because they stopped fighting it.
- A sunpatch clearing turns into an impromptu rest stop.
- A lantern_wren’s song keeps repeating the same calm phrase.
- A stream_otter appears twice in one day, like it’s checking in.
- The forest chooses clear daylight as a quiet “welcome back.”
