- Echo Thunder rolls right after someone tells the truth they were avoiding.
- A guide pauses: “That means the path changed again.”
- The mirrorpool_marker vanishes exactly as the thunder fades.
- A tense group quiets, realizing the storm isn’t coming here.
- A character thinks danger is near—then learns it’s only an echo.
- Two travelers hear it differently: one finds comfort, one feels warning.
- Echo Thunder follows the echo_shift_path like it’s attached to it.
- Someone returns home, and the thunder sounds like a far-off door closing.
