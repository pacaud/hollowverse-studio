- A heated conversation softens as Drift Snow starts falling.
- Footprints appear that shouldn’t—too light, too careful.
- A safe route reveals itself because the snow “pads” the right path.
- Someone writes a promise in the snow and watches it blur into peace.
- A lantern glow turns each flake into a tiny floating ember.
