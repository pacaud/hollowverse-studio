[vibe]
steady crossing, gentle movement, safe route

[description]
A line of flat stones across the cottage_stream.
They never wobble. They never sink. They’re quietly reliable.

[nearby]
- silverleaf_fern along the bank
- dewleaf_cluster at dawn
- ribbonred_bush sometimes near the approach

[lore]
- The crossing is a promise: you can move forward without being rushed.
- Good for “small courage” moments.

[use]
- transition scenes
- walks from cottage
- “okay, one step” pacing
