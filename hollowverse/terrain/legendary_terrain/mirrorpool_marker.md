[vibe]
quiet truth, gentle clarity, sacred calm

[description]
A small pool that reflects more than the sky—sometimes it reflects *a feeling*.
It is never found the same way twice. Some find water; others find a smooth stone circle
with the *idea* of water in the center.

[behavior]
- appears only at meaningful turning points
- never forces revelations
- disappears if approached with urgency or hunger

[lore]
- The forest’s way of offering clarity without demand.
- Not a test. Not a trap. A soft mirror.

[use]
- restoration milestones
- vow moments
- “I can be honest with myself” scenes

[rules]
- Never taken from
- No throwing stones, no bottles, no collecting
- If you see it: sit, breathe, and leave it undisturbed
