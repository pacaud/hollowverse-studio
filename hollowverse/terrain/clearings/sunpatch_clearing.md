warm, easy, gentle daylight

A small clearing where sunlight lands in a steady patch, even when the forest is dim.
It feels like the trees made room on purpose.

- a few flat, warm stones
- starpetal clusters near the edges

[nearby]

- illusion_level: low
- safety: high

[use]
- low-pressure breaks
- “it’s okay to be here” moments
