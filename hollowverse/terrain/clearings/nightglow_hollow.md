[vibe]
night-soft wonder, calm magic, safe mystery

[description]
A shallow hollow-like clearing that only feels “fully visible” at night.
In moonlight, small details seem to appear: glimmers, rings, soft reflections.

[ground]
- mooncap clusters in loose arcs
- occasional moonthread_blossom nearby
- lantern_moss_fern in the dimmest pockets

[nearby]
- echo_birch saplings
- starcurrant_bush sometimes visible in moonlight

[behavior]
- reliable: medium (best visited at night)
- illusion_level: medium (reveals, doesn’t confuse)
- safety: medium-high (go slow, stay calm)

[use]
- gentle discovery scenes
- “the forest is listening kindly” moments

[rule]
If you feel uneasy, leave. The hollow won’t follow you.
