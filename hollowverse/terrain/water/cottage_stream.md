[vibe]
clean, calming, gentle movement

[description]
A narrow, steady stream that runs close enough to the cottage to be heard faintly
when the wind is right. It’s not loud—more like a soft thread of sound.

[water_behavior]
- flow: gentle, consistent
- clarity: clear with occasional leaf drift
- sound: quiet, soothing, steady

[banks]
- smooth stones that warm in sunlight
- silverleaf_fern and dewleaf_cluster nearby
- occasional ember_gill on fallen logs

[crossings]
- a simple stone-step crossing (stable, safe)
- a small fallen-log bridge farther upstream

[lore]
- The stream feels like the forest’s “breathing.”
- A good place to rinse hands, cool down thoughts, or pause quietly.

[use]
- grounding walks from cottage
- morning tea scenes (sound in background)
- “reset without leaving home” moments

[notes]
Not a survival resource. It exists for calm and atmosphere.
