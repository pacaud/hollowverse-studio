## Privacy rule (locked)
These reports should **not** include:
- email addresses or Windows usernames
- hostnames / computer names
- serial numbers
- MAC addresses
- IP addresses

## Naming rule (so wiring stays stable)
- Use **one filename per machine**, and only replace the file contents when refreshing.
- If you later add more machines, add them as new files and list them here.
