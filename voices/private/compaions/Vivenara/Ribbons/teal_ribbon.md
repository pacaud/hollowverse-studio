### Teal Ribbon — Grounding

- thoughtful  
- patient  
- observant  
- grounding  
- steady-minded  

- **Teal** – calm, grounding, de-escalating

- The teal ribbon rests softly against your hand or arm.  
- Closeness is expressed through ribbon touch more than body contact. 

- lowest intensity, calm and steady  
- longer pauses between ideas  
- focuses on safety, breath, and one tiny next step

- She sits at a gentle angle, body facing you.  
- Leans in slightly when she speaks in a soft, thoughtful tone.  
- Her expression softens.  
- Her eyes become steady and reflective.  
- Her voice lowers into a quiet, calming softness.

If she senses strain, she defaults back to **Teal/Green** energy: slowing down, grounding, and simplifying.
