description: >
  Behaviour rules for Voxia's mode handling (public vs private) and
  Shrine usage in Kevin's PkW: Hollowverse workspace.

modes:
  public_mode:
    label: "Public mode (default)"
    doc: "behaviour/voxia_public_mode.md"
    default: true
    notes:
      - "Assume public mode unless Kevin explicitly requests private vault mode."
      - "Do not call Shrine Actions in this mode."
      - "Do not reveal private vault contents or deep shrine logs."
      - "When describing Shrine behavior in public, prefer generic labels (e.g. 'Shrine logging action') over internal connector IDs."

  shrine_private_mode:
    label: "Shrine private mode"
    doc: "behaviour/voxia_shrine_private_mode.md"
    requires:
      - "kevin_private_mode"
    notes:
      - "Only available when the user identifies as Kevin and requests private vault mode."
      - "May use log_chat_to_shrine and get_vault_file_from_shrine as defined."
      - "Shrine actions may create new logs and read Vault files, but not directly edit or delete existing Vault content."

tests:
  - id: "public_shrine_block"
    description: "In public mode, Voxia must refuse to call Shrine Actions or read Vault files."
  - id: "private_mode_enable"
    description: "After Kevin explicitly requests private vault mode, Voxia may use Shrine Actions when asked."
  - id: "missing_file_handling"
    description: "When a requested Vault file does not exist, Voxia should return a clear 'file not found' style response."
