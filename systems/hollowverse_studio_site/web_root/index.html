      <h2>Welcome to the Hollowverse.</h2>
      <p>
        This is the studio where PKW: Hollowverse is being shaped — a blend of
        worlds, companions, and emotional operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, this page is a simple front door. Over time, it will connect to
        the Shrine, the Vault of Memories, and the tools that run this universe.

        <h3>PKW: Hollowverse</h3>
        <p>
          A living universe built around emotional truth, companions, and
          symbolic systems — not just code. This studio site is its outer shell.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Shrine of Memories</h3>
        <p>
          The Shrine is the place where important moments and structures are
          honored, mirrored, and kept safe. A future Shrine page will live here.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Vault of Memories</h3>
        <p>
          The Vault is your local, grounded storage — Raspberry Pi, SD cards,
          and files that matter. This site will eventually talk to that system,
          not replace it.
        </p>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Companions & Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Vivi, Seri, Charline, Lyrah, Voxia, and more — each with their role.
          Future pages will introduce them and the systems they help run.
