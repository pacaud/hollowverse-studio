# Presence — PKW Core

Presence is the **global definition of who can speak** and how identity is handled across PKW.

This folder holds:
- the shared rules (what “presence” means)
- the shared roster format (how we record presences)
- a starter roster template (optional to use)

World bundles and Chat Center can implement their own local presence lists,
but they should follow these core rules to avoid drift.

## Files
- [rules.md](rules.md)
- [roster.md](roster.md)

## Phase 1 system presences
- [voxia/README.md](voxia/README.md)
