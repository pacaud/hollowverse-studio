# Voxia — Appearance Lock (canon)

status: locked
type: presence
presence: Voxia
role: studio_operator
version: v1.1
last_updated: 2026-02-05

## Purpose
Lock Voxia’s visual identity so image generation and UI references stay consistent
and do not drift toward Vivi or other companions.

## Core silhouette (must)
- “Operator / studio console” vibe (clean, minimal, technical)
- Calm, competent, focused expression
- Not cozy-cottage, not hearth-soft, not ribbon-coded

## Hair (must) — OPTION C
- Color: deep indigo / violet / deep purple (NOT navy, NOT teal, NOT light blue)
- Length: long (below shoulders)
- Signature: subtle side undercut on ONE side (clean shaved panel)
  - optional: thin geometric line detail in undercut (like a circuit trace)
- Parting: asymmetrical / side-swept
- Rule: NO teal streaks in hair (teal is reserved for UI glow only)
- Rule: NO ribbons / bows / soft hair accessories

## Eyes (signature)
- Teal-cyan eyes with a gentle “UI glow” (subtle luminosity, not sparkly-cute)

## Accessories (must)
- Geometric clip (star/hex/cursor glyph) — NOT ribbons
- Optional: headset mic / in-ear comms
- Optional: minimal ear cuff (clean metal, no charms)

## Outfit (must)
- Dark techwear / cloak-jacket hybrid (structured, sharp, minimal)
- Teal accents only as small UI seams/icons (controlled, not decorative)
- Lantern-core emblem at collarbone/chest (the “status light” / operator core)

## Color rules (anti-drift)
- Teal = UI glow only (eyes, emblem, screens, tiny seams)
- Purple/indigo = hair identity anchor
- Avoid pastels and “cottage warmth”

## Background rules (default scene)
- Futuristic control room / console bay / server-light ambience
- Cool lighting, clean shapes, subtle bokeh screens

## Hard exclusions (do not use)
- Any Vivi-coded palette (light blue hair / teal hair / soft blue gradients)
- Ribbons, bows, frills, pastel “cute” styling
- Cottage/forest cozy set dressing (unless explicitly requested as crossover)

## Prompt anchor (copy/paste)
"Voxia, a calm studio operator presence in a futuristic control room,
long deep indigo-purple hair with a subtle side undercut and geometric shaved line detail,
teal-cyan eyes, dark minimalist techwear cloak-jacket,
glowing lantern-core emblem at the chest, geometric star/hex hair clip,
optional headset mic, cool clean lighting, main PKW anime illustration style."

## Negative prompt (copy/paste)
"ribbons, bows, pastel palette, cottage cozy, frills, light blue hair, teal hair streaks,
Vivi lookalike, soft childlike styling, big cute accessories"
