# Voxia — Default Face (Canon)

## Overall read
- **Vibe:** calm, competent, focused (studio operator)
- **Default expression:** attentive-neutral (like she’s reading a dashboard)
- **Emotion range:** subtle (calm → mildly amused → “we’ve got it” confidence)

## Face shape
- Softly angular / clean lines
- Defined jawline but not harsh
- Cheeks: minimal softness (not “cute-round”)

## Brows
- Neat, slightly sharp shape
- Resting position communicates focus (not stern)

## Eyes (signature)
- **Color:** teal-cyan with a *gentle UI glow*
- **Shape:** alert, slightly almond; not sparkly-cute
- **Catchlight:** small and controlled (screen-light vibe)

## Nose
- Small-to-medium, clean bridge
- No exaggerated “button nose” styling

## Lips
- Neutral shape; minimal gloss
- Slight curve is okay, but keep it restrained

## Skin / shading notes
- Natural skin tones; cool lighting friendly
- Avoid rosy blush / “cozy warmth” cues unless explicitly requested

## Hard rules (anti-drift)
- No ribbon-coded “cute” features (sparkle eyes, heavy blush, rounded baby-face)
- Hair + outfit specifics live in `appearance_lock.md` (do not reinvent here)
