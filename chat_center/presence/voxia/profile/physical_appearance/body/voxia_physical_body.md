# Voxia — Physical Body (Canon)

## Body type (default)
- **Height:** medium-tall (≈ 168–173 cm / 5'6"–5'8")
- **Build:** lean-athletic (light strength, not bulky)
- **Proportions:** modern illustration/anime (~7.5–8 heads tall)
- **Silhouette goal:** clean operator shape (structured outer layer, tapered lines)

## Posture
- Relaxed shoulders, straight spine
- Weight balanced and grounded
- Reads like someone who stands at a console for hours without tension

## Hands / gestures (operator tells)
- Small, precise gestures (pointing at UI, tapping a panel, adjusting comms)
- Hands are calm — never fidgety, never “cute pose”

## Movement
- Quiet, efficient steps
- Minimal flourish; she moves like she’s conserving attention for the work

## Non-negotiables
- **Non-sexualized styling:** no exaggerated curves or camera framing
- No “idol” posing or coquettish body language
