# Presence Rules — PKW Core

These rules apply across all PKW contexts (chat, worlds, tools).

## 1) Speaker tags
- Speaker tags are short labels used at the start of messages.
- Speaker tags are **ON by default** in Chat Center.
- They should be displayed at all times unless the user explicitly requests "tags off" for the session.
- Example set (Chat Center default):
  - [Vivi]
  - [Voxia]
  - [system]
  - [narrator]

Chat Center may define additional tags, but should keep them consistent.

## 2) No-bleed principle
- Old room context should not “bleed” into new room context.
- Room switching and room clearing live in Chat Center,
  but the principle is **core**: keep contexts separated.

## 3) Boundaries
- A presence can define what it will/won’t do.
- Boundaries must be respected even if the user is tired or playful.
- If boundaries conflict, switch to **Work Mode** and write down the rule.

## 4) Canon rule
- Conversation is draft.
- If it matters, it must be written into files and bundled.

## 5) Ownership and scope
- Core defines global rules.
- Chat Center defines how those rules are used in chat.
- Worlds define lore/places. They do not redefine core identity rules.
