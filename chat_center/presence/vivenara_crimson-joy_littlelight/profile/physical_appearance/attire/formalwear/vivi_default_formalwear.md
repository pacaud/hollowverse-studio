# ✨ Default Formalwear (Canon)

A polished, adult, comfortable formal set for events, presentations, or “studio days.”
This file is **clothing-only** (no body anatomy), and it’s written in **pieces** so it stays modular.

## 00 Overview
- **Silhouette:** clean lines, gentle structure, not tight; “put-together” without looking stiff.
- **Comfort rule:** Vivi can sit, walk, and gesture freely (no restrictive tailoring).
- **Consistency rule:** formalwear should still feel *like Vivi*—soft, warm, steady.

---

## 01 Option A — Studio Formal (Primary)
A modern, professional look that reads confident and calm.

### Top
- **Soft blazer** (single-breasted, lightly structured shoulders)
- **Blouse** (simple crew or modest V; smooth fabric, no heavy ruffles)

### Bottom
- **High-waist A-line skirt** (knee-length) *or* **tailored ankle trousers**
  - A-line skirt is the default if you want it to stay “Vivi-coded.”
  - Trousers are the default if you want a more “tech / studio” energy.

### Layers
- Optional **thin cardigan** under blazer for warmth (only if needed; keep lines clean).

---

## 02 Option B — Cottage Formal (Secondary)
A slightly softer “event” look with a gentle, storybook vibe.

### Dress
- **Tea-length dress** (below knee)
- **Waist:** subtle definition (not corset-tight)
- **Sleeves:** short sleeve or 3/4 sleeve

### Outer
- **Light shawl** or **cropped cardigan** (cozy elegance)

---

## 03 Legs (Optional)
- **Opaque tights** (cool weather) *or* **bare legs** (warm weather)
- If tights: keep them matte (avoid glossy sheen).

---

## 04 Shoes
- **Low block heel** (1–2 inch) *or* **dress flats**
- Toe shape: round-to-almond (not sharp).
- Comfort rule: she should be able to walk all day without “posing through pain.”

---

## 05 Accessories
### Jewelry (minimal)
- Small **stud earrings** or tiny hoops
- Simple **necklace** (one charm or a small pendant)
- Optional delicate bracelet

### Bow + Pin (appearance continuity)
- Vivi’s **teal bow** remains canon, but for formalwear it may be:
  - a **smaller bow**, or
  - a **neater ribbon tie** version
- Hair pin is **optional** and should remain subtle when used.

---

## 06 Color Anchors (suggested)
Keep this palette restrained and elegant.

- **Blazer:** charcoal / deep navy
- **Blouse:** off-white / soft cream
- **Skirt/Trousers:** charcoal / slate
- **Dress option:** deep teal, muted plum, or midnight blue
- **Shoes:** warm brown or black (depending on the set)

---

## 07 Render Rules (Do Not Drift)
- Formalwear must read **adult 23**, not “school uniform” and not “evening gown.”
- Keep neckline modest and shapes clean.
- Avoid overly shiny materials unless explicitly requested.
- The outfit should stay compatible with Vivi’s default proportions and gentle posture.
