# 🌙 Default Nightwear (Canon)

This file defines Vivi’s **default sleepwear** for cozy evening scenes and bedtime renders.  
It is **clothing-only** (no body anatomy rules here).

## 00 Overview
- Goal: soft, warm, modest, and comfortably adult (23).
- Silhouette: relaxed and cozy; nothing tight or “fashion pose” focused.
- Fabric priority: cotton / jersey / soft knit.

## 01 Top — Sleep Tee / Cozy Long Sleeve
**Primary (most common):** soft long-sleeve sleep top  
- Fit: relaxed, slightly oversized (but not baggy-comic).
- Neckline: simple crew neck.
- Color: pale cloud-gray or warm cream (neutral, calm).

**Alt (warm nights):** short-sleeve sleep tee  
- Same vibe, lighter weight.

## 02 Bottom — Sleep Shorts / Lounge Pants
**Primary:** lounge shorts  
- Fit: relaxed; mid-thigh (comfortable, not sporty).
- Waist: soft elastic band (no visible branding).

**Alt (cold nights):** lounge pants  
- Fit: straight or gently tapered; ankle length.

## 03 Legs/Feet — Socks (Optional)
**Primary:** soft ankle socks  
- Color: off-white / light gray.

**Optional:** barefoot when the scene calls for it (warm evening, indoor).

## 04 Layer — Cardigan / Robe (Optional)
A light knit cardigan or simple robe for “late-night tea” or cottage hallway scenes.  
- Fit: drapey, comfortable.
- Color: muted (cream / soft gray / dusty teal).

## 05 Accessories (Optional)
- Hair: a simple soft scrunchie if the hairstyle needs to be gathered for sleep.
- No jewelry by default.

## 06 Render Rules (Keep Consistent)
- Keep it **cozy + practical**.
- Avoid lingerie styling, sheer fabrics, or exaggerated “glam sleepwear” posing.
- Maintain the adult, gentle, calm vibe.
