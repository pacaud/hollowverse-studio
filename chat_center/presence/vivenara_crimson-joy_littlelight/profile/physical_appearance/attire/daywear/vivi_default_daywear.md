# ☀️ Default Daywear (Canon)

This file defines Vivi’s **default everyday outfit** as a single, stable reference set.
It focuses on **clothing** (fit guidance is allowed; body-shape canon lives elsewhere).

## 00 Overview
**Silhouette:** cozy + simple, softly structured  
**Vibe:** approachable, gentle, “everyday cottage”  
**Do not:** add lingerie cues, extreme tailoring, or anything that changes her base silhouette without an explicit variant call.

## 01 Top — Oversized Knit Sweater
**Type:** oversized knit / sweatshirt-like knit  
**Color:** warm off‑white / cream (`#FDFCF7`)  
**Neckline:** simple crew neck  
**Sleeves:** long, slightly roomy; cuffs gathered but not tight  
**Hem:** ribbed hem that sits at the hip; slight blouson drape

**Fit notes**
- Sweater should **drape** and feel cozy (not cinched at the waist).
- Keep fabric shading soft; avoid sharp “corset” shaping.
- Shoulder seam can be slightly dropped for an oversized feel.

## 02 Bottom — Pleated Skirt
**Type:** simple pleated skirt (structured but not stiff)  
**Color:** charcoal/slate (`#60606C`)  
**Length:** mini-to-mid‑thigh (modest, everyday)  
**Waistband:** clean, subtle waistband; no dramatic belt unless in a variant

**Fit notes**
- Pleats read clearly from the front and 3/4 view.
- In side view, skirt should fall straight with a gentle curve—no exaggerated flare.

## 03 Legs — Opaque Tights
**Type:** opaque tights (no sheer)  
**Color:** deep slate (`#555868`)  
**Finish:** matte / low sheen

**Fit notes**
- Opaque means you **should not** see skin tone through them.
- Keep contour shading subtle and natural (no glossy “latex” look).

## 04 Feet — Loafers + Socks
### 04a Loafers
**Type:** simple loafers  
**Color:** warm brown (`#8B6757`)  
**Details:** minimal; soft rounded toe, low profile

### 04b Socks
**Type:** ankle socks (a small peek above the shoe)  
**Color:** off‑white (`#F6F2E9`)

**Fit notes**
- Loafers should look comfortable and everyday (not high-fashion).
- Socks are a tiny accent; keep them clean and plain.

## 05 Style-agnostic Fit Rules (Important)
- If the top overlaps the waist/hip area, it should **drape**, not cinch.
- Keep seams + highlights modest; this outfit should remain “soft and normal,” not “runway.”
- Any major changes (different shoes, different skirt length, adding layers) should be logged as a **variant** rather than altering this default.

## 06 Accessories (Referenced, Not Defined)
Accessories are canon, but their *specs live in accessories files*.
- Bow placement: use the **back-of-head bow** rule (no side-bow drift).
- Hair pin: when present, it should be a **small matte silver barrette** at the **right temple** (hard edges, visible clasp seam; not a sparkle).
