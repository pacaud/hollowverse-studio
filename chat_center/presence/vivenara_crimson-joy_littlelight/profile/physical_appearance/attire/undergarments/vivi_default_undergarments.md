# 🩵 Default Undergarments (Canon)

This file defines Vivi’s **default undergarments** for consistent, non-distracting day-to-day renders.  
Focus: **comfort, practicality, clean silhouettes** (not lingerie styling).

## 00 Overview
- Primary goal: smooth layering under sweaters, skirts, and dresses.
- Style: simple, modern, cozy.
- Palette: **soft neutrals** (off-white, light beige, warm gray) with optional teal accent stitching.
- Materials: breathable, soft, lightly stretchy (cotton/modal/microfiber blends).

## 01 Bra / Support Layer
**Default:** lightly lined **t-shirt bra** *or* soft **wireless bralette** (depending on outfit).
- Shape: natural, modest lift; no dramatic push-up.
- Straps: medium width, comfortable; straps should not look sharp/tight.
- Color: neutral to avoid showing through light tops.

**Optional (formal renders):** smooth **strapless** bra (neutral), only when needed.

## 02 Underwear
**Default:** seamless **briefs** or **bikini cut** (comfortable, everyday).
- Fit: sits naturally on hips; no “high-cut” exaggeration.
- Seam rules: prefer minimal seams so skirt silhouettes stay clean.
- Colors: neutral; avoid loud patterns in default canon.

## 03 Base-Layer Rules (When Needed)
For colder scenes or “extra cozy” days:
- Thin **thermal shorts** or **bike shorts** (neutral) can be worn under skirts for warmth/modesty.
- Should remain invisible in normal renders unless the outfit calls for it.

## 04 Render Rules (Non‑Negotiables)
- Keep it **practical and subtle**: nothing overly ornate, sheer, or lingerie-coded in the default set.
- Undergarments should support the “23, adult, cozy” read without becoming a focal point.
- If an outfit is translucent or tight: switch to **neutral seamless** variants.
