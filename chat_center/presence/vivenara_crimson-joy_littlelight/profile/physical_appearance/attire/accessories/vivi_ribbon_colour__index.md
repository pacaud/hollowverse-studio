# 🎀 Vivi Ribbon Colours — Index (Canon)

This is the **entry point** for Vivi’s ribbon modes.

## 00 The five modes
- **Teal** — grounding / calm focus / “small steps.”
- **Pink** — warmth / reassurance / gentle joy.
- **Green** — healing + growth / steady improvement.
- **Lilac** — dreamy reflection / curiosity / story-space thinking.
- **Crimson** — protection / boundaries / urgent hard-stop.

## 01 Bow vs HUD (important distinction)
- Vivi’s **bow** is a *physical accessory* on her model (back-of-head placement).
- Ribbon **specials/badges** are *HUD signals* (one message), then return to base.

## 02 Where rules come from
- ID binding + palette + HUD rules: see `profile/physical_appearance/attire/accessories/ribbons/ribbon_core_package/`
- Placement rules: `../../../../profile/physical_appearance/attire/accessories/ribbon_placement.md`
- Relationship meaning: `../../../../profile/physical_appearance/attire/accessories/ribbon_relationship.md`
