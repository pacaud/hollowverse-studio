# ⌁ Vivi Wristbands — Pair (Canon)

This file defines Vivi’s **two wristbands** as a matched accessory set (left + right).  
This revision matches the current **icy-skyblue** wristband design image.

## 00 Overview
- **Accessory name (canon):** Vivi Knit Wristbands (Pair)  
- **Count:** 2 (left + right)  
- **Default use:** optional everyday accessory (can be on or off depending on outfit)  
- **Vibe:** soft, calm, quietly cute — not flashy  

## 01 Design (Non-Negotiable)
### Shape
- Classic cuff/wristband shape that sits around the wrist.
- Rounded outer edge and soft profile (no sharp corners).

### Material
- **Soft knit / terry fabric** (canon)
  - slightly plush texture
  - matte finish (no shine)

### Size / Fit
- Medium width: **~3–4 cm**
- Snug but not tight; no squeezing lines.
- Doesn’t bulk up the hands or distort wrist anatomy.

## 02 Color (Canon Default)
### Base Color (both bands)
- **Icy skyblue** (light, airy, cozy)  
- Texture should read as fabric, not rubber or plastic.

### Stitch / Seam Detail
- A subtle seam line (like a thin band around the middle) is allowed.
- Keep stitching subtle and tone-matched (no loud contrast).

## 03 Left vs Right (Pair Rules)
### Left Wristband (Plain)
- Solid icy skyblue.
- No emblem.

### Right Wristband (Leaf Emblem)
- Same icy skyblue base.
- **Leaf emblem** on the outer face:
  - **Outline:** crisp white
  - **Fill:** icy skyblue (slightly brighter/lighter than the band so it stays readable)
  - Keep the emblem small and clean (icon-like, not detailed embroidery threads).

They should read as a **matched pair**, not two unrelated accessories.

## 04 Placement Rules
- Sits above the wrist bone, below the palm base.
- In 4-view character sheets, visible in front/3⁄4/side; back view may show partial edges.

## 05 What It Must NOT Become
- metal bangles (unless explicitly asked)
- spiked / edgy cuffs
- thick athletic sweatbands with loud logos
- shiny silicone bracelets (unless explicitly requested as a variant)

## 06 Image-Gen Prompt Fragment (Copy/Paste)
> two soft knit wristbands, icy skyblue, matte terry texture, medium width 3–4 cm, one plain and one with a small leaf emblem (white outline, lighter icy-skyblue fill), cozy everyday accessory, not sporty cosplay, not shiny

## 07 Filenames (Recommended)

## 08 Variants (Optional, Not Canon Yet)
- **Teal mode variant:** shift the base color toward teal (keep the same leaf rules)
- **Crimson accent variant:** leaf outline remains white, with a tiny crimson stitch tag (separate file/version)
