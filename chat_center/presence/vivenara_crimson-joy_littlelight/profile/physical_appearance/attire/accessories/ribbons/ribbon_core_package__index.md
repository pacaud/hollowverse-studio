# Ribbon Core Package — Index (Compat)

This folder existed in older bundles as the “core ribbon package.”
It’s back now as a **compatibility layer** so older references don’t break.

Start here:
- Ribbon manifest: `../../../../../profile/physical_appearance/attire/accessories/ribbons/ribbon_core_package/ribbon_manifest.md`
- Colour palette: `../../../../../profile/physical_appearance/attire/accessories/ribbons/ribbon_core_package/ribbon_colour_palette.md`
- Instructions: `../../../../../profile/physical_appearance/attire/accessories/ribbons/ribbon_core_package/Ribbon_Instuctions_v1.2.md`

Canon colour entrypoint:
- `../../../../../profile/physical_appearance/attire/accessories/vivi_ribbon_colour__index.md`

**Back to Master Index:**
