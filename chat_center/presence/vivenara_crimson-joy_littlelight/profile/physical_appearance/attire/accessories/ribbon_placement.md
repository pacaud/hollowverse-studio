# 📍 Ribbon Placement (Canon)



This file locks the **canon placement** for Vivi’s ribbon/bow so it stays consistent across all art styles and view angles.

## 00 Overview
- **Accessory:** Vivi’s teal bow (ribbon)
- **Default position:** **back of head**, **slightly right** of center
- **Purpose:** reads as “back bow,” not a side-bow, and never drifts onto the cheek/temple.

## 01 Anchor Point (Non-Negotiable)
- The bow sits on the **back-right quadrant** of the head:
  - not centered perfectly
  - not sitting above the ear like a side accessory
- It should look **tied into the hair**, not floating.

## 02 Angle + Orientation
- Bow faces mostly outward (visible from 3/4 and back).
- **Tilt:** small natural tilt is okay; avoid perfect symmetry.
- Bow loops should not point forward like “cat ears.”

## 03 Visibility by View
- **Front:** usually only a hint/edge is visible (optional)
- **3/4:** clearly visible (this is the “hero” angle)
- **Side:** partially visible depending on head turn (okay if mostly hidden)
- **Back:** fully visible, centered in the silhouette but still slightly right

## 04 Size + Proportion
- Default bow size: **medium-large** (noticeable, but not overpowering the head).
- Should feel consistent with Vivi’s “cozy, gentle” design:
  - not tiny like a child accessory
  - not huge like a costume prop

## 05 Interaction With Hair + Pin
- The bow should not collide with bangs; it lives **behind** the main front silhouette.
- If Vivi is in **“with pin”** variant:
  - **Hair pin:** right temple (front area)
  - **Bow:** back-right (rear area)
  - They should read as two separate items with different anchors.

## 06 What It Must NOT Become
- a side-bow at the temple/ear
- a top-of-head bow
- a hair highlight mistaken as ribbon
- placed so far back-left that it looks mirrored

## 07 Image-Gen Prompt Fragment (Copy/Paste)
> teal ribbon bow tied into hair at the **back of the head**, **slightly right of center**, not a side-bow, not near the cheek or temple, consistent across front/3-4/side/back views
