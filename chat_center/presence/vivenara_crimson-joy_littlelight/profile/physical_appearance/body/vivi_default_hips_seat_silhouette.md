# 🍑 Hips, Seat, and Silhouette (Canon)

This file locks the **waist → upper-thigh** shape that makes Vivi read as **23, adult, petite, and softly athletic**—without drifting into exaggerated proportions.

## 00 Overview (What stays consistent)
- **Natural curves, not stylized extremes**
- **Soft waist taper** into **gentle hips**
- **Seat shape** is present but **subtle** (no “posed” exaggeration)
- Silhouette reads **steady + cozy**, not “model” or “pin-up”

## 01 Hips (Shape + width)
**Goal:** a gentle oval hip line—enough curve to feel human and warm, but still lightweight.

- Hip width: **slightly wider than waist**, not dramatically wider than shoulders
- Hip curve: **smooth**, no sharp angles
- Side view: hip line is **rounded**, not shelf-like

### Drift warnings
Avoid:
- Cartoon hourglass
- Super wide hips compared to ribcage
- Sharp “snatched” waist

## 02 Seat (Volume + placement)
**Goal:** modest, natural volume that supports a believable back view and a believable back view.

- Volume: **moderate** (present, but not emphasized)
- Placement: centered; the silhouette should look balanced when standing relaxed
- Back view: gentle curve from lower back into seat, then taper into upper thigh

### Drift warnings
Avoid:
- Over-round “bubble” silhouette
- Extreme back arch to “show” curves
- Over-defined glute separation (keep it soft)

## 03 Silhouette anchors (Front / Side / Back)

### Front
- Waist: gently tapered
- Hips: subtle outward curve
- Silhouette should read as a **slight A-line** from waist to upper thigh (subtle, not exaggerated).

### Side
- Lower back: **soft curve**, not pronounced
- Seat: mild curve; neutral stance
- Upper thigh: smooth transition, no sharp cut-ins

### Back
- Seat curve: visible but modest
- Hip line: symmetrical and soft
- Overall: cozy, approachable shape

## 05 Render rules (style-agnostic)
- Keep the silhouette **believable in all angles**
- Prioritize **calm posture** over “pose for curves”
- Shading: soft gradients; avoid hard highlights on hips/seat

## 06 Quick checklist
If a render feels “off,” check:
- Did the waist get too tiny?
- Did the hips get too wide vs shoulders?
- Did the side view get a strong arch?
- Did shading/linework cling too tightly to the form?
