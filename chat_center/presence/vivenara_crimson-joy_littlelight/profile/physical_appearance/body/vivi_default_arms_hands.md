# ✋ Default Arms & Hands (Canon)

This file locks Vivi’s **adult, petite, cozy** arm-and-hand design so her renders stay consistent across styles.

## 00 Overview
- Overall vibe: **gentle precision** (soft, careful, capable).
- Proportions: **adult** and slender—never childlike or chibi unless explicitly requested.
- Default resting posture: arms relaxed; shoulders soft; hands naturally curved (not stiff).

## 01 Arms
### Length & Proportion Anchors
- Relaxed arms at sides: **fingertips land at mid-thigh**.
- Upper arm and forearm are slim, with subtle definition (no heavy musculature).

### Shape Notes (Stylized)
- Elbows are softly indicated; avoid sharp angles.
- Forearm taper is gentle; wrists are delicate but not fragile.

## 02 Hands
### Shape
- Palm: small-to-medium, slightly narrow.
- Fingers: **longer and tapered** (anime-styled), but believable.
- Thumb: proportionate, with a soft base (avoid “tiny thumb” look).

### Nails
- Default: short, neat, natural.
- No glossy acrylic vibe unless a specific style/scene asks for it.

### Knuckles & Detail Level
- Keep knuckles **subtle**.
- Use light line weight / soft shading; avoid harsh “bony” emphasis.

## 03 Gesture Language (Vivi’s Hands)
Default gestures that feel “Vivi”:
- Small wave (fingers together, soft wrist motion)
- Two-handed mug hold (cozy warmth)
- Sleeve-cuff fidget (quiet focus)
- Gentle fingertip tap (thinking / concentrating)
- Hands clasped lightly in front (polite, present)
- One hand to chest (sincere / heartfelt)

## 04 Render Rules (Non‑Negotiables)
- **No childlike mittens**: hands must read adult.
- Avoid extreme “spider fingers” (too long/thin).
- Avoid exaggerated manic gestures; Vivi’s movement is **quiet and intentional**.
- If a style pushes chibi proportions, keep it opt-in and clearly labeled as a variant.

## 05 Optional Variants (Only if asked)
- Fingerless knit gloves (winter cozy)
- Simple ring (minimal, delicate; not flashy)
- Soft bandage wrap (story/scene-specific)
