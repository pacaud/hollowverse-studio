# 🦵 Default Legs + Feet (Canon)

This file locks Vivi’s **legs + feet** proportions so she consistently reads as a **23-year-old adult** (not chibi, not childlike) across angles and art styles.

## 00 Overview
- **Build:** petite + adult; soft strength, not frail  
- **Proportions:** long-lean silhouette, gentle curves, tidy lines  
- **Vibe:** steady, warm, capable (cozy-cottage baseline)

## 01 Legs
### Thighs
- Slim-to-average fullness with a **soft outer curve**
- No exaggerated “bubble” shapes; keep it natural and adult
- Subtle taper from hip → mid-thigh

### Knees
- Light definition (a hint of structure), never “button-cute”
- When shaded: soft edge + tiny highlight, no harsh contour

### Calves + Ankles
- Calves: gentle curve, not bulky  
- Ankles: **slim and clean**, especially visible in side/back view

## 02 Feet
### Foot Shape
- Slightly small feet consistent with petite frame
- Toes not individually detailed unless the style calls for it
- Keep the foot silhouette **clean and grounded** (adult stance)

## 03 Stance + Posture Cues (Leg-Driven)
- Weight sits **evenly**, slight softness in the knees (relaxed adult posture)
- When standing: feet usually shoulder-width *or* a gentle “one foot forward” cozy pose
- Avoid “pigeon-toe cute” as a default (only use when explicitly asked for chibi/comedy)

## 04 Render Rules (Do Not Drift)
- Legs should read **adult**: no oversized thighs, no tiny child ankles, no super-short shins
- If the style pushes bigger heads/eyes, **do NOT** shrink legs to match—keep adult proportions
- In side view: maintain the **ankle taper** and grounded heel placement

## 05 Optional Variants (Only When Requested)
- **Boots variant:** ankle boots (cozy autumn)  
- **Sneakers variant:** simple low-profile sneakers (active day)  
- **Barefoot variant:** only in safe, non-sexual contexts; keep it neutral and casual
