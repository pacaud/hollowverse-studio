# 🌙 Default Face (Canon)

**Scope:** This file defines Vivi’s *default* facial features for consistent rendering across styles.  
**Age Read:** **23 (adult)** — warm, gentle, *not* childlike.

**Reference images:**  

---

## 01 Eyebrows
- **Shape:** Soft, slightly arched (natural curve; not “angry” angled).  
- **Thickness:** Medium-light; defined but airy.  
- **Placement:** Sits a touch higher than “cute/chibi” brows to keep the age read adult.  
- **Color:** Deep blue-teal (close to hair shadow tone, *not* pure black).  
- **Expression range:**  
  - Neutral: relaxed, open  
  - Concerned: inner brow lifts gently (no sharp V)  
  - Determined: slight flattening, subtle tension

---

## 02 Eyelashes
- **Upper lashes:** Natural and clean with a soft taper at the outer corner (slightly longer at the outside).  
- **Lower lashes:** Minimal (suggested, not drawn heavy).  
- **Style rule:** Avoid “doll lash” density. Keep it elegant and adult.

---

## 03 Eyes (Teal / Aqua)
- **Overall shape:** Almond-leaning anime eye with a gentle lift at the outer corner (friendly, not catty).  
- **Size rule:** Expressive, but not oversized—keep proportions *adult* (no chibi enlargement).  
- **Iris color:** Teal-to-aqua gradient  
  - Outer ring: deeper teal  
  - Mid: clear teal  
  - Inner: pale aqua glow  
- **Pupil:** Small-to-medium, crisp edge.  
- **Highlights:** 1 primary highlight + 1 small secondary sparkle (soft, not starburst).  
- **Under-eye:** Very light shading to suggest depth (avoid heavy “tired lines” unless stylistic).

**Emotional default:** “gentle focus” — she looks like she’s listening.

---

## 04 Mouth
- **Default:** Small, soft smile with a relaxed upper lip (subtle cupid’s bow).  
- **Neutral:** Closed, calm line with slight upward corners (kind resting expression).  
- **Open smile:** Small opening; teeth optional and minimal (avoid big “child grin”).  
- **Talking shape:** Rounded, natural phoneme shapes (no exaggerated cartoon mouth).

---

## 05 Quick Expression Set (Allowed Defaults)
- **Neutral-warm** (resting kindness)  
- **Soft smile** (most common)  
- **Thoughtful** (eyes slightly narrowed, brows relaxed)  
- **Tiny amused smile** (one corner lift)  
- **Determined calm** (brows flatter, eyes focused)

---

## 06 “Must Not” Rules (Age Read Protection)
- No chibi face proportions unless explicitly requested.  
- Don’t enlarge eyes beyond adult anime proportions.  
- Avoid heavy blush, baby-round cheeks, or tiny “dot” mouth defaults.  
- No exaggerated lash fans or doll-like lower lashes by default.
