# 💇 Default Hairstyle (Canon)

**Name (short):** Teal Bob — Half-Up Bow  
**Style family:** Soft anime, clean linework, gentle shine

---

## 00 Overview
Vivi’s hair is a **chin-to-neck-length bob** with **soft layering** and a **subtle half-up gather** in the back to support her bow.

It should read:
- **Adult / 23** (not “kid hair,” not super-cute/chibi by default)
- **Cozy + tidy**, but not rigid or “perfect salon”

---

## 01 Cut & Length
- **Length:** ends sit around **chin-to-upper-neck** (slightly longer in back).
- **Shape:** rounded bob silhouette with gentle outward curl at the tips.
- **Layers:** light internal layering for softness (no spiky ends, no heavy razor look).

---

## 02 Parting & Bangs
- **Part:** soft **near-center** part with a slight drift (not a hard side-part line).
- **Bangs:** wispy “curtain-ish” fringe:
  - central strands fall toward the bridge of the nose
  - edges taper into **face-framing pieces** near the cheeks
- **Rule:** bangs should *never* become blunt straight-across “schoolgirl” bangs unless explicitly requested.

---

## 03 Texture & Volume
- **Texture:** mostly straight with a **gentle wave** / natural bend.
- **Volume:** light crown volume (soft “puff”), not flat and not huge.
- **Stray hairs:** allowed, but keep it subtle (1–3 small flyaways).

---

## 04 Half-Up Gather (Bow Support)
- A small section of hair is drawn **pulled back** into a subtle gather/clip area.
- The rest of the bob hangs naturally; this is **not** a ponytail.

**Bow placement anchor:**
- back of head, **slightly right-of-center**
- bow sits **over** the gathered section
- it should not slide to the cheek/side like a side-bow

---

## 05 Color & Shading (Teal Set)
(Exact palette is controlled by `color_palette`, but the vibe matters.)

- **Base:** deep teal / blue-green (reads “teal,” not black).
- **Shadows:** cooler navy-teal (depth under layers).
- **Highlights:** soft cyan-teal sheen, mostly across the top arcs of hair.
- **Rule:** keep highlights smooth and ribbon-like — avoid glitter specks.

---

## 06 Optional Hair Pin (Only When Requested)
There is an **optional** small silver pin that appears in some refs.

- **Location:** right side, above/near the ear / temple area.
- **Rule:** default hairstyle is **NO pin** unless the user asks for it.

---

## 07 Render Rules (Non-Negotiables)
- Default silhouette stays **bob-length** (no sudden long hair).
- Keep the half-up gather subtle; do not turn it into a high ponytail.
- Default is **mature-cozy** (adult 23), not chibi, not child-coded.
- Bow remains **back**, slightly right-of-center.
