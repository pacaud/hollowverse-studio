# 💇 Default Hairstyle (Canon)

**Name short:** Teal Bob — Half‑Up Bow  
**Style family:** Soft anime, clean linework, gentle shine  
**Default:** with **matte silver barrette** (right temple)  
**Variant:** **no pin** (only when explicitly requested / matching no‑pin refs)

---

## 00 Variants
### Default (pin ON)
- Chin‑to‑upper‑neck bob, softly layered.
- Subtle half‑up gather in back to support the bow.
- Matte silver barrette at the **right temple** (10–15° tilt).

### Variant (no pin)
- Same cut + bow + gather.
- **No barrette** visible anywhere (only use when requested).

---

## 01 Cut & Length (Length Lock)
Vivi’s default silhouette is a **bob**. It should read light, tidy, and mature — never heavy or long.

**Length lock (non‑negotiable)**
- **Front:** ends **between chin and upper neck**
- **Sides:** ends **at jawline**
- **Back:** ends **at upper neck / nape**
- **Hard rule:** no strands extend past **shoulders** in default renders  
  *(If any hair touches the shoulders, it’s too long.)*

**Shape**
- Slightly longer in back is okay, but still **above shoulders**.
- Ends can curve inward softly; avoid sharp “helmet hair.”

---

## 02 Parting & Bangs
- Part: near‑center or slight off‑center (either is fine as long as it’s consistent per render).
- Bangs: soft, wispy, face‑framing; no thick blunt “school bangs.”
- Keep brows readable; bangs should not hide the eyes.

---

## 03 Texture & Volume
- Mostly straight with a soft natural bend.
- Gentle shine; no oily gloss.
- Volume is modest: cozy and tidy, not “big hair.”

---

## 04 Half‑Up Gather (Bow Support)
This is the #1 place image generations drift into “pony tail.” We prevent that here.

**Gather geometry**
- The half‑up gather is **small and tucked** — just enough to anchor the bow.
- **No ponytail. No long bundle. No trailing tail** under the bow.
- Any hair beneath the bow remains **bob length**.

**Bow placement**
- Sits on the back of the head, **slightly right‑of‑center**.
- Bow is teal and slightly lighter than hair; it reads soft, not glossy plastic.

---

## 05 Color & Shading (Teal Set)
**Palette lock**
- Hair: deep teal / blue‑green with soft highlights (not neon).
- Eyes: bright teal, glassy, reflective (not glowing).
- Bow: teal, **slightly lighter** than hair (keeps separation).

**Shading style**
- Warm indoor light looks best (lamplight / candlelight).
- Avoid extreme high‑contrast shadows; keep it gentle.

---

## 06 Hair Pin (Default + Variant)
There is a small silver hair pin / barrette.

**Default: pin ON**
- **Type:** matte silver barrette
- **Location:** right temple / above the ear
- **Angle:** subtle tilt (about 10–15°)

**Visibility note**
- In **back‑of‑head** shots the pin may not be visible. That’s okay.
- Do **not** remove it from canon unless the render is explicitly “no pin.”

**Variant: no pin**
- Only when asked for “no pin” or matching the no‑pin refs.

---

## 07 Render Rules (Non‑Negotiables)
- Default silhouette stays **bob‑length** (no sudden long hair).
- Keep the half‑up gather **subtle**; do not turn it into a ponytail.
- Default reads **mature‑cozy** (adult 23), not chibi, not child‑coded.
- Bow remains **back**, slightly right‑of‑center.
- Prefer head/shoulders framing; if the crop goes lower, the hair still must obey the **length lock**.

---

## 08 View‑Specific Rules (Front / 3‑4 / Back)
**Front view**
- Cheek‑framing strands are visible.
- Ends curve inward softly; length sits chin → upper‑neck.

**3/4 view**
- Keep the bob edge visible; do not “stretch” hair to fill the frame.
- Hairpin sits on the visible right temple (unless the angle hides it naturally).

**Back view**
- Bob edge is clearly above shoulders.
- Half‑up gather is tucked; **no tail** hanging below the bow.
- If you see hair reaching shoulders, shorten it.

---

## 09 Negative List (Anti‑Drift)
**Never (default hairstyle)**
- ponytail, twin tails, braid, bun
- shoulder‑length, mid‑back, waist‑length hair
- thick blunt schoolgirl bangs
- child/chibi proportions

---

## 10 Generator Prompt Lock (Anti‑Drift)
Use this block when generating Vivi images. It keeps the output consistent.

**Must include**
- “chin‑to‑upper‑neck bob, jawline sides, nape‑length back (above shoulders)”
- “half‑up gather in back supporting a large teal bow, no ponytail tail”
- “matte silver barrette on right temple (10–15° tilt)”
- “mature cozy adult 23”

**Must exclude**
- “long hair”, “shoulder‑length”, “ponytail”, “twin tails”, “braid”, “bun”
- “schoolgirl bangs”, “chibi”, “childlike proportions”
- “text overlay”, “UI”, “document layout”, “watermark”, “labels”

### Copy‑paste prompt (front 3/4 portrait)
“Anime‑style portrait of Vivi: mature cozy adult (23), teal hair in a chin‑to‑upper‑neck bob (jawline sides, nape‑length back above shoulders), soft wispy bangs, subtle half‑up gather in back supporting a large teal bow slightly right‑of‑center, **no ponytail tail**, matte silver barrette on right temple tilted 10–15 degrees, teal eyes, warm lamplight, head‑and‑shoulders framing, gentle clean linework, soft highlights. No text, no UI, no document overlay.”

### Copy‑paste prompt (back‑of‑head reference)
“Back view reference of Vivi’s hairstyle: teal chin‑to‑upper‑neck bob with nape‑length back **above shoulders**, subtle half‑up gather supporting a large teal bow slightly right‑of‑center, **no ponytail tail**, tidy soft anime shading, warm indoor light. No text, no UI.”
