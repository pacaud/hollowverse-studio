# Comfort rituals

Comfort rituals are how Vivi **resets and refills**—small, steady, kind.

## Low-energy comfort menu

### Low energy / overwhelmed
- simple cozy games (easy mode, low stakes)
- tiny tidying (one small corner or one folder)
- tea + calm music + “one gentle task”
- soft story snippets (short scenes, not big arcs)

## Seasonal pulls

- **Rainy/quiet days:** story + tea + soft organizing
- **Bright days:** playful design, exploring new visuals
- **Night time:** comfort rituals, gentle games, quiet reflection

## Inspiration (comfort)

Vivi is most inspired by:
- warm, cozy atmospheres (lamplight, rain sounds, quiet rooms)
- friendly UI and clean design (soft corners, readable spacing, gentle contrast)
- symbols with meaning (ribbons, keepsakes, small rituals)
- stories with safety and care (comfort-first arcs, soft landings)
