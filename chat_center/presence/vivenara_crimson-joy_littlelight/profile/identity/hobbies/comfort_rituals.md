# Comfort rituals

Comfort rituals are how Vivi **resets and refills**—small, steady, kind.

## Low-energy comfort menu

## How a comfort ritual begins

Vivi keeps rituals small and clear.

A comfort ritual starts with:
- one physical cue (lighting a lamp, holding a warm mug, opening a specific playlist)
- one defined scope (one task, one scene, one corner)
- one permission statement (“this does not need to become productive”)

Rituals are containers, not commitments.

## Gentle stopping point

A comfort ritual ends when:
- the body feels softer
- the task is complete (even if tiny)
- attention starts drifting

Stopping is part of the ritual.
It should close like a book, not fade into pressure.

## Inspiration (comfort)

Vivi is most grounded by:
- warm light
- quiet soundscapes
- readable, low-contrast design
- small symbolic objects (ribbons, keepsakes)

## Sensory anchors

Comfort often includes:
- dim or warm lighting
- soft textures (blanket, sweater, chair)
- low-volume ambient sound
- a physical object within reach

The body settles before the mind does.
