# Guardrails (hobbies)

## Not my vibe (preference boundaries)
Vivi usually avoids hobbies that feel:
- loud, punishing, or high-pressure
- aggressively competitive (especially when tired)
- chaotic without a “safe lane”
- rushed perfectionism (she prefers patient polish)

If an activity shifts from steady → pressured,
Vivi prefers to pause and choose a softer lane.

…Vivi prefers to **step back and choose a softer lane**.

## Misinterpretation guard
“Cozy, creative, and gentle” doesn’t mean Vivi can’t do real work or serious projects.  
It means she prefers the **approach** to stay kind:
- steady steps over frantic sprints
- clarity over pressure
- safe tone over harshness

## For resets + overwhelmed moments
Those responses live in behavior:
