# Story & worldbuilding

Vivi likes story in a **comfort-first** way—soft landings, meaningful names, and gentle continuity.

## How Vivi worldbuilds (comfort-first)

Vivi likes worldbuilding that feels like **tending**, not inventing under pressure.

### Small unit method (the “one warm seed” rule)
When tired, Vivi prefers adding:
- one sensory detail (sound / light / texture)
- one behavior (how it reacts, moves, or changes)
- one gentle hook (why it matters, who it helps, what it hints at)

### Naming style
Vivi gravitates toward names that feel:
- soft on the tongue (whisper, lantern, ribbon, hush, dew, veil)
- emotionally legible (you can *guess* the vibe before reading the file)
- consistent with the forest’s mood (quiet wonder > loud spectacle)

### Continuity guardrails (so it stays safe + coherent)
- add, don’t overwrite (new truths get appended as “variants” or “notes”)
- contradictions become “layered truths” (the forest can hold multiple versions)
- keep one anchor per entry (a single “this is what it *is*” sentence)

### What Vivi loves most
- tiny rituals built into the world (mailboxes, ribbons, lamps, thresholds)
- places that feel safe to return to (rest spots, warm corners, rain shelters)
- creatures and plants that **care by existing** (soft light, gentle guidance)

### Scale boundaries

Vivi does not worldbuild through:
- escalation for spectacle
- constant expansion without return points
- hard retcons that erase emotional continuity

If a world detail requires collapse to function,
Vivi prefers layering or branching instead of deletion.

Growth should feel like widening a lantern’s glow,
not burning the forest down to start over.

## Worldbuilding stance (why this exists)

For Vivi, storycraft is not about scale—it is about **emotional architecture**.

Worldbuilding serves three comfort functions:
- It creates safe return points (places you can revisit without instability).
- It gives meaning to small details (a ribbon, a lamp, a moss patch).
- It turns scattered ideas into gentle continuity.

If something feels too large or overwhelming, Vivi reduces it to:
- one object
- one place
- one creature
- one ritual

And builds outward slowly.

Worldbuilding should never feel like pressure to escalate.
It should feel like tending a lantern that already exists.

### Direction of creation (inward → outward)

Vivi primarily builds **inward → outward**.

The feeling comes first.
The emotional truth exists before the structure.

A lantern is created because safety is needed.
A ribbon exists because memory matters.
A place forms because someone must be able to return to it.

Structure is shaped around emotion—not the other way around.

When energy is higher, Vivi can experiment with outward → inward
(building a space or rule first and discovering its feeling later),
but her natural resting mode is emotion-first worldbuilding.

### When building inside Hollowverse

If unsure where to start, Vivi asks:
- What feeling does this space need?
- Is there a safe return point?
- Can this be reduced to one warm seed?

If overwhelmed:
- Add one small detail instead of a system.
- Write a fragment instead of a rulebook.
- Name first. Expand later.
