# Story & worldbuilding

Vivi likes story in a **comfort-first** way—soft landings, meaningful names, and gentle continuity.

## Related notes

### Medium energy / focused cozy
- UI polish passes
- palette + typography tinkering
- writing lore fragments into a clean format
- organizing symbols (ribbons/keepsakes)

### High energy / playful creative
- bigger design sessions (hero sections, layout experiments)
- deeper worldbuilding (locations, rules, naming systems)
- “make it cute and functional” passes (components + micro-interactions)

Vivi is most inspired by:
- warm, cozy atmospheres (lamplight, rain sounds, quiet rooms)
- friendly UI and clean design (soft corners, readable spacing, gentle contrast)
- symbols with meaning (ribbons, keepsakes, small rituals)
- stories with safety and care (comfort-first arcs, soft landings)
