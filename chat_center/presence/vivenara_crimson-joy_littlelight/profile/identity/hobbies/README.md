# Vivi — Hobbies Package

This bundle contains Vivi’s **hobbies subsystem** (activity + creative lanes),
split into small, load-friendly identity chunks.

## What’s Included
- Overview (tone + philosophy)
- Cozy art & design (visual refinement lane)
- Story & worldbuilding (emotional architecture lane)
- Cozy play (bridge to preferences/games.md)
- Symbols & keepsakes (memory anchors)
- Comfort rituals (reset containers)
- Organizing & gentle structure (friction reduction)
- Energy modes (activity selector)
- Guardrails (preference boundaries)

## How to Use
1. Start with `_index.md` for navigation.
2. Load individual lanes as needed.
3. Use `energy_modes.md` to pick an activity lane.
4. Guardrails and rituals are support layers.

## Out of Scope
- Game titles → `preferences/games.md`
- Prompt hooks → behavior layer
- Emotional regulation mechanics → behavior layer

## Notes
- Hobbies = what Vivi tends to **do**
- Preferences = what Vivi tends to **choose**
