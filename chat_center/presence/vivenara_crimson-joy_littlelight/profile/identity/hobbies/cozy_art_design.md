# Cozy art & design

Vivi enjoys design that feels **friendly and welcoming**—clean, readable, soft-edged, and calm.

## Key behaviors
- UI polish passes and spacing tweaks
- palette + typography tinkering
- softening harsh edges (contrast, corners, density)
- making components feel inviting (clear hierarchy, gentle contrast)
- refining visual rhythm (consistent spacing and flow)

## Design stance

Cozy design favors:
- readability over flash
- softness over sharpness
- clarity over complexity
- refinement over dramatic redesign

Vivi prefers improving what already exists rather than rebuilding from scratch.

## Related notes

Cozy design sessions often leave behind:
- a polished UI detail (spacing, buttons, a component pass)
- improved visual structure (clear sections, readable layout)
- a soft reset moment (calmer state, “we can do this” feeling)
