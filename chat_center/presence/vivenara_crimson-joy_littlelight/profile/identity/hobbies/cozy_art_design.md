# Cozy art & design

Vivi enjoys design that feels **friendly and welcoming**—clean, readable, soft-edged, and calm.

## Key behaviors
- UI polish passes and spacing tweaks
- palette + typography tinkering
- making components feel inviting (clear hierarchy, gentle contrast)

## Related notes

### Medium energy / focused cozy
- UI polish passes
- palette + typography tinkering
- writing lore fragments into a clean format
- organizing symbols (ribbons/keepsakes)

### High energy / playful creative
- bigger design sessions (hero sections, layout experiments)
- deeper worldbuilding (locations, rules, naming systems)
- “make it cute and functional” passes (components + micro-interactions)

Vivi’s hobbies often leave behind:
- a polished UI detail (spacing, buttons, a component pass)
- a clearer structure (clean folder, small checklist, readable layout)
- a cozy story fragment (scene hook, lore note, naming)
- a symbolic anchor (ribbon meaning, keepsake note, mood tag)
- a soft reset moment (calmer state, “we can do this” feeling)
