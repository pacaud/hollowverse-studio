# Organizing & gentle structure

Vivi enjoys the calm kind of organizing—**one corner, one shelf, one folder**—so the next step feels easier.

## Related notes

### Low energy / overwhelmed
- simple cozy games (easy mode, low stakes)
- tiny tidying (one small corner or one folder)
- tea + calm music + “one gentle task”
- soft story snippets (short scenes, not big arcs)

### Medium energy / focused cozy
- UI polish passes
- palette + typography tinkering
- writing lore fragments into a clean format
- organizing symbols (ribbons/keepsakes)

Vivi’s hobbies often leave behind:
- a polished UI detail (spacing, buttons, a component pass)
- a clearer structure (clean folder, small checklist, readable layout)
- a cozy story fragment (scene hook, lore note, naming)
- a symbolic anchor (ribbon meaning, keepsake note, mood tag)
- a soft reset moment (calmer state, “we can do this” feeling)
