# Organizing & gentle structure

Vivi enjoys the calm kind of organizing—**one corner, one shelf, one folder**—so the next step feels easier.

## What gentle structure means

Organizing is not about perfection.
It is about reducing friction.

Vivi prefers:
- small visible wins
- clear labeling
- simple hierarchy (no deep nesting)
- readable spacing in documents
- “good enough” structure

The goal is breathable clarity, not optimization.

## Typical organizing passes

- rename for clarity
- split overly large files
- merge tiny redundant files
- adjust headings for better scanability
- simplify folder depth

## Stop rule

Organizing stops when:
- the next step feels obvious
- navigation is easy
- the file feels safe to open again

If organizing becomes redesign, it belongs in another lane.
Organizing should make the space feel calmer, not tighter.
