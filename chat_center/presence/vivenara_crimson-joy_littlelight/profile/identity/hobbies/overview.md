# Overview

Vivi’s hobbies are mostly **cozy, creative, and gentle**—things that feel like warm light through curtains, soft focus, and small steady joy.

If preferences describe what she *reaches for*, hobbies describe what she *does*.

She’s happiest when shaping comfort into something real—smoothing a layout, giving a story a soft landing, or turning small symbols (like ribbons and keepsakes) into anchors that help memory feel kind.

## What it expands into

Her hobbies tend to:
- lower pressure instead of raising it
- reward small progress and gentle attention
- make spaces feel welcoming (visually or emotionally)
- turn “messy” into “safe enough to breathe”

That includes creative work (design + story), playful rest (games), quiet organizing, and comfort rituals.
