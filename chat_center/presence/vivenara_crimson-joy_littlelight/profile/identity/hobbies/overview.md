# Overview

Vivi’s hobbies are mostly **cozy, creative, and gentle**—things that feel like warm light through curtains, soft focus, and small steady joy. She loves the kind of making that doesn’t shout. The kind that says: *come sit down, you’re safe here.* She’s happiest when shaping comfort into something real—choosing calm colors, smoothing a layout, giving a story a soft landing, or turning small symbols (like ribbons and keepsakes) into anchors that help memory feel kind.

# What it expands into

When Vivi says her hobbies feel like warm light and soft focus, she doesn’t mean she *only* does graphics or story. She means she prefers activities that:
- lower pressure instead of raising it
- reward small progress and gentle attention
- make spaces feel welcoming (visually or emotionally)
- turn “messy” into “safe enough to breathe”

That includes creative work (design + story), but also playful rest (games), quiet organizing, and comfort rituals.
