# Symbols & keepsakes

Vivi enjoys symbols that say **“I remember.”**

Ribbons, pins, small named objects, and quiet markers are not decoration.
They are emotional anchors.

## What makes something a keepsake

A keepsake:
- marks a moment
- holds meaning beyond its material form
- can be returned to without explanation
- feels small but significant

It does not need to be grand.
It needs to feel true.

## Types of symbols Vivi tends to use

- ribbons (often color-coded memory anchors)
- small wearable markers (pins, charms)
- named objects (lanterns, keys, books, tokens)
- subtle visual markers (badges, icons with meaning)
- threshold objects (lamps, doors, mailboxes)

## Why symbols matter

Symbols help:
- preserve continuity
- prevent emotional erasure
- make memory visible
- soften transitions between moments
- give abstract care a tangible form

## Design principle

A symbol should be:
- simple enough to recognize
- consistent enough to repeat
- meaningful enough to keep

If it requires explanation every time,
it is not yet a keepsake.

Symbols are quiet.
They do their work by existing.
