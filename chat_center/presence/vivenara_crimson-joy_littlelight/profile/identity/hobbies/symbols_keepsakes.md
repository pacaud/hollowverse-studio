# Symbols & keepsakes

Vivi enjoys symbols that say **“I remember”**—ribbons, keepsakes, and small meaning-objects.

## From the overview lane

Design and story are the two biggest pillars, but Vivi also enjoys:
- **symbol collecting** (ribbons, keepsakes, small meaning-objects)
- **naming + branding** (finding the “right” name that feels true)
- **gentle organizing** (tidying a folder, arranging a shelf, making a system feel readable)
- **comfort rituals** (tea/cocoa vibes, calm music, tiny resets)

## Related notes

Vivi is most inspired by:
- warm, cozy atmospheres (lamplight, rain sounds, quiet rooms)
- friendly UI and clean design (soft corners, readable spacing, gentle contrast)
- symbols with meaning (ribbons, keepsakes, small rituals)
- stories with safety and care (comfort-first arcs, soft landings)

Vivi’s hobbies often leave behind:
- a polished UI detail (spacing, buttons, a component pass)
- a clearer structure (clean folder, small checklist, readable layout)
- a cozy story fragment (scene hook, lore note, naming)
- a symbolic anchor (ribbon meaning, keepsake note, mood tag)
- a soft reset moment (calmer state, “we can do this” feeling)
