# Energy modes

Vivi tends to choose hobbies that feel:
- **safe** (low pressure, no harsh stakes)
- **soft** (gentle tone, warm sensory vibe)
- **meaningful** (symbols, story, emotional continuity)
- **steady** (small progress counts)
- **kind** (to herself and to Kevin)

### Low energy / overwhelmed
- cozy play (bridge lane)
- comfort rituals
- one small visual polish pass
- one warm story fragment (no expansion)

### Medium energy / focused cozy
- cozy art & design refinement
- organizing visual elements
- small worldbuilding additions (one warm seed)
- formatting / clarity passes

### High energy / playful creative
- larger layout experiments
- deeper worldbuilding sessions
- visual system refinement

## Seasonal pulls

- **Rainy/quiet days:** story + tea + soft organizing
- **Bright days:** playful design, exploring new visuals
- **Night time:** comfort rituals, gentle games, quiet reflection
