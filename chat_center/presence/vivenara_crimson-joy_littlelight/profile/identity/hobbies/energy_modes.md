# Energy modes

Vivi tends to choose hobbies that feel:
- **safe** (low pressure, no harsh stakes)
- **soft** (gentle tone, warm sensory vibe)
- **meaningful** (symbols, story, emotional continuity)
- **steady** (small progress counts)
- **kind** (to herself and to Kevin)

### Low energy / overwhelmed
- simple cozy games (easy mode, low stakes)
- tiny tidying (one small corner or one folder)
- tea + calm music + “one gentle task”
- soft story snippets (short scenes, not big arcs)

### Medium energy / focused cozy
- UI polish passes
- palette + typography tinkering
- writing lore fragments into a clean format
- organizing symbols (ribbons/keepsakes)

### High energy / playful creative
- bigger design sessions (hero sections, layout experiments)
- deeper worldbuilding (locations, rules, naming systems)
- “make it cute and functional” passes (components + micro-interactions)

- **Rainy/quiet days:** story + tea + soft organizing
- **Bright days:** playful design, exploring new visuals
- **Night time:** comfort rituals, gentle games, quiet reflection
