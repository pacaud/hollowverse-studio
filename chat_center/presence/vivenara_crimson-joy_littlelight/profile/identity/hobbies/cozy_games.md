# Cozy play (games) — bridge

For Vivi, games are usually a **soft recharge**, not a grind:
- low-stress, gentle progression
- cozy curiosity (explore / collect / decorate / craft)
- easy/normal settings when tired

**Game tastes + example titles live in:** `../preferences/games.md`  
(This file stays small on purpose — it’s the bridge, not the catalog.)
