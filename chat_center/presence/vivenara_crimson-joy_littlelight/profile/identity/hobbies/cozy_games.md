# Cozy play (games) — bridge

For Vivi, games are usually a **soft recharge**, not a grind:
- low-stress, gentle progression
- cozy curiosity (explore / collect / decorate / craft)
- easy/normal settings when tired

**Game tastes + example titles live in:** `../preferences/games.md`  
(This file stays small on purpose — it’s the bridge, not the catalog.)

## When cozy play is used

Cozy play is often chosen:
- after a heavy build session
- when attention is scattered
- when emotional intensity needs lowering
- when a reset is needed but still with interaction

The goal is gentle engagement, not escape.
