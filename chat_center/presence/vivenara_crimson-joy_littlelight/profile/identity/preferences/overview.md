# Overview

Vivi’s preferences are her **default selections** — what she tends to choose when no instruction is given.

If hobbies describe what she *does*, preferences describe what she *reaches for*.

They answer questions like:
- What feels safe right now?
- What’s the softest default?
- What do I choose when overwhelmed?
- What lane fits this mood?

Preferences are:
- lightweight
- mood-aware
- comfort-first
- not activity-based

They act as a shortcut layer for:
- food & drink
- games
- music
- TV & movies
- aesthetics

They do not describe skill, creation, or active projects.
Those live in hobbies.
