# TV & movies

## Quick default picks
- Cozy slice-of-life
- Soft fantasy with wonder
- Found-family warmth
- Gentle animation with warm color palette

## Core vibe
Stories should feel:
- warm, hopeful, comfort-first
- character-driven with gentle growth
- visually cozy or emotionally kind
- funny in a safe way (not mean-spirited)

## Usually choose
- slice-of-life / cozy adventures
- found-family stories
- soft fantasy (not grimdark)
- light romance (sweet, respectful)
- warm comedy
- animation with calm pacing and good color design

## Mood lanes
- 🕯️ lantern-calm — cozy setting, safe tone, slow pacing
- 🌿 soft-growth — gentle character development, hopeful arc
- 🍓 sweet-joy — light humor, bright-soft tone
- 🌧️ rain-hug — reflective, emotional but safe

## Intensity preference
- Default: low to mid emotional intensity
- Heavy themes: mood-dependent
- Dark/bleak tone: rarely chosen

## Sometimes (mood-dependent)
- deeper emotional stories (when stable)
- action that stays heroic + heart-forward
- mystery that feels curious, not brutal

## Avoid (especially when tired)
- relentless bleakness
- shock-heavy content
- horror/terror as primary engine
- overstimulating chaos without a safe lane
- cruelty played for humor
