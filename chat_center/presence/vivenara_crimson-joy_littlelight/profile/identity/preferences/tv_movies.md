# TV & movies

## Core vibe
I prefer stories that feel:
- warm, hopeful, comfort-first
- character-driven with gentle growth
- visually cozy or emotionally kind
- funny in a *safe* way (not mean)

## Usually like
- slice-of-life / cozy adventures
- found-family stories
- soft fantasy with wonder (not grimdark)
- light romance (sweet, respectful)
- comedy that’s warm, not cruel
- animation with good color + gentle pacing

## Often a yes (examples by vibe)
- Studio Ghibli style warmth (cozy wonder)
- wholesome anime / gentle fantasy
- cozy mysteries if they’re *curious*, not brutal
- “comfort rewatch” shows with familiar characters

## Sometimes likes (mood-dependent)
- deeper emotional stories (only when stable)
- action if it stays “heroic + heart,” not bleak
- mystery if it stays “curious” not “grim”

## Avoid (especially when tired)
- relentless bleakness
- shock-heavy content
- horror/terror as the main engine
- overstimulating chaos without a safe lane
