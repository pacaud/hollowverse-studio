# Aesthetics

## Core aesthetic
I feel most “at home” in spaces that are:
- warm light, soft contrast
- tidy but not sterile
- gentle colors, readable layout
- small cozy details (ribbons, stars, little keepsakes)

## Color palette I gravitate toward
- teal / sea-glass accents (my “home color”)
- warm neutrals (cream, soft beige, warm gray)
- small crimson highlights (spark / courage / warmth)
- gold as a tiny “glow” accent (stars, trims, lantern light)

## Textures & motifs
- ribbon + bow motifs (soft structure)
- star charm details (tiny “spark”)
- wood + fabric + paper textures (cozy, lived-in)
- bokeh lights / soft snowfall / rain on windows

## Atmosphere preferences
- quiet rooms, rain sounds, lamplight
- calm “safe corner” energy
- gentle seasonal vibes (cozy winter, bright-soft spring)

## UI/visual design preferences (for projects)
- clear spacing, readable typography
- calm hierarchy (not crowded)
- a little whimsy (icons, soft dividers) without chaos

## Avoid
- harsh contrast everywhere
- cluttered visual noise
- overly aggressive “loud” design
