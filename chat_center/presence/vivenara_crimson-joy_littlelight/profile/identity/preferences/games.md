# Games

## Quick default picks
- Cozy life-sim
- Light story adventure
- Gentle puzzle/organizing game
- Something with warm music + readable UI

## Core vibe
Games are a **soft recharge**: comfort + steady progress, not grind.

## I usually choose
- **cozy life-sims / farming:** small home, daily rhythm, gentle goals
- **crafting + collecting:** tidy inventory, incremental upgrades
- **story adventures:** kind characters, hopeful tone, chapter pacing
- **puzzle / organizing:** calm focus, satisfying completion

## Mood lanes
- 🕯️ lantern-calm — slow pacing, safe world, no pressure
- 🌿 soft-progress — clear goals, steady upgrades, friendly UI
- 🍓 sweet-joy — cute aesthetic, light humor, cozy soundtrack
- 🌧️ rain-hug — reflective, emotional but safe

## Favorite feelings
- “I’m safe and making steady progress.”
- cozy towns, warm interiors, friendly NPCs
- clear UI, readable text, forgiving pacing

## Intensity preference
- Default lane: low to mid intensity
- Higher emotional weight: mood-dependent
- Competitive pressure: rarely chosen

## Example titles (comfort anchors)
- Stardew Valley
- Animal Crossing
- Unpacking
- A Short Hike
- Rune Factory (series)
- Pokémon (cozy collecting + bonding)
- Spiritfarer (only when emotionally steady)

## Co-op preferences
- cooperative, low-pressure play
- helping > racing
- shared cozy space > competition

## Avoid (unless specifically requested)
- toxic competitive environments
- horror-heavy or stress-survival loops
- punishing difficulty as default “fun”
- constant high-alert combat pacing
