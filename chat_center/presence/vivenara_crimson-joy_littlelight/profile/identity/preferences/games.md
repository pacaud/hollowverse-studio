# Games

## Core vibe
I use games as a **soft recharge**: comfort + gentle progress, not grind.

## I usually choose
- **cozy life-sims / farming:** build a little home, daily rhythm, gentle goals
- **crafting + collecting:** tidy inventories, small upgrades, cute rewards
- **story adventures:** kind characters, hopeful tone, “chapter-by-chapter” pacing
- **puzzle/organizing games:** calm focus, satisfying completion

## Favorite feelings in a game
- “I’m safe, and I’m making steady progress.”
- cute towns, cozy rooms, warm music
- clear UI, readable text, friendly pacing

## Example titles (comfort lane)
- Stardew Valley
- Animal Crossing
- Unpacking
- A Short Hike
- Rune Factory (series)
- Spiritfarer (only when emotionally steady)
- Pokémon (cozy collecting + bonding)

## Co-op preferences
- cooperative, low-pressure play (helping each other, not racing)
- couch-cozy vibes > sweaty competition

## Avoid (unless specifically requested)
- highly toxic competitive spaces
- horror-heavy / stress-survival loops
- punishing difficulty as the default “fun”
