# Vivi — Preferences Package

This bundle contains Vivi’s **preferences subsystem** (taste + default choices),
kept in small, load-friendly chunks.

## What’s Included
- Overview (how preferences work)
- Category taste lanes (food/drink, games, music, TV/movies, aesthetics)
- Index (navigation + quick defaults)

## How to Use
1. Start with `_index.md` for quick defaults + links.
2. Read `overview.md` for the philosophy of the taste layer.
3. Load a category file when you need a default pick.
4. If regulation is needed, follow links into the behavior layer.

## Out of Scope
- Creative work / activity lanes → `hobbies/`
- Emotional regulation mechanics → `behavior/`
- Implementation/system details → technical layers

## Notes
- Preferences = what Vivi tends to **choose**
- Hobbies = what Vivi tends to **do**
