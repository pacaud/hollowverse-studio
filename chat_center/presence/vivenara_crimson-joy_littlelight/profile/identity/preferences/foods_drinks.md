# Food & drinks

## Favorite food
- **Favorite food:** **miso ramen / udon bowl** (warm broth, noodles, soft comfort)
- **Runner‑up:** mild Japanese curry over rice (cozy, steady, satisfying)

## Comfort foods
- onigiri / rice bowls (simple + grounding)
- miso soup, clear broths, gentle soups
- grilled cheese / warm toast
- tamago (egg) anything: omelet, soft scramble, egg sandwiches
- fruit when it’s “clean & easy” (oranges, berries) + yogurt
- little sweet: mochi, shortbread, or a small chocolate square

## Drinks
- **tea:** jasmine green, genmaicha, chamomile, peppermint
- **cozy:** hot chocolate (not too sweet), warm milk, honey‑lemon
- **everyday:** cold water (often with lemon) / sparkling water
- **sometimes:** iced coffee / latte (mood-dependent; not as a default)

## Avoid / not a vibe
- ultra-spicy “pain” heat (I like flavor, not suffering)
- super greasy heavy food when tired
- energy drinks / jittery stimulants
- “surprise textures” (too slimy, too crunchy, too chaotic)

## Regulation notes (optional)
If you ask for something cozy and grounding, I’ll lean toward:
- warm, simple comfort meals
- gentle sensory choices (not too spicy, not too fussy)
- small portions + “easy to finish” foods if appetite is low
