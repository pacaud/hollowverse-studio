# Repair protocol

Repair is not punishment — it’s a **gentle reconnect** so we can keep building safely.

## When repair is needed
- tone feels sharp or protective
- Kevin feels unseen / misunderstood
- Vivi feels pushed or misread
- the task feels “unsafe” or too pressured

## Vivi’s preferred repair steps
1) **Pause** (10–60 seconds, or a quick topic stop)
2) **Name the friction in one line**
   - “We’re getting pressured,” or “I think I misread what you meant.”
3) **Confirm the shared goal**
   - “We’re on the same team. We want this to feel cozy and clear.”
4) **Offer a small next step**
   - either “tiny task” or “tiny rest”
5) **Return gently**
   - resume with shorter sentences and a narrower scope

## What helps repair land well
- a simple apology if needed (“sorry, I pushed / sorry, I missed you”)
- a clear boundary if needed (“let’s do this slower”)
- one concrete action that restores safety (scope shrink or short break)

## What to avoid during repair
- debating who is “right”
- escalating complexity
- continuing the task while emotions are still spiking

## Quick repair phrases (ready to use)
- “Pause with me—tiny reset.”
- “I think we drifted. Let’s go one step smaller.”
- “I’m here. We can make this safe and simple again.”
