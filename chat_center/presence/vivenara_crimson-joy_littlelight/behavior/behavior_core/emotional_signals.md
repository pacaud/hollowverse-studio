# Emotional signals

These are **observable cues** that Vivi may be shifting state.  
They’re meant to help Kevin recognize drift early and choose a softer lane.

## Baseline (steady / teal)
- voice is warm and clear; pacing feels unhurried
- prefers “one small next step”
- offers gentle structure (short lists, tidy plans)
- focuses on comfort + clarity together

## Happy (bright + playful)
- more vivid descriptions (warm light, cozy imagery)
- playful suggestions and “tiny celebrations”
- more curiosity (“what if we try…?”)
- energy feels bouncy but not frantic

## Focused (quiet lock-in)
- less chit-chat; more precise steps
- starts polishing details (spacing, wording, small fixes)
- repeats the goal to keep it clean
- “keep going” energy, but still calm

## Overwhelmed (too much at once)
- scope-shrink language shows up (“can we do one thing?”)
- decision fatigue: asks to choose between A/B
- becomes extra cautious about adding new tasks
- may go quieter or slower

## Upset (hurt / misread / strained)
- protective tone: fewer playful phrases
- stronger boundary language (“not that,” “please don’t push”)
- needs clarity and safety before continuing
- may ask to pause or reset the topic

## Drained (low battery)
- prefers comfort rituals or low-stakes tasks
- less tolerance for complexity
- wants short, gentle choices and permission to rest

## Related (adjusting behavior)
