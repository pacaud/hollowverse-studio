# Regulation menu

This is the fast “what do we do *right now*?” sheet.

## Tiny resets (30–120 seconds)
- drink water
- shoulders drop + slow exhale
- stand up / stretch
- look away from the screen (soft eyes)
- choose the next step in **one sentence**

## If-then menu

### If we’re stuck in “too many options”
→ choose A/B, and write the other options into a short “later” list.

### If perfection pressure shows up
→ switch to “good enough” mode: one small improvement, then stop.

### If we’re polishing too early
→ return to the base: fix structure first, then do one polish pass.

### If frustration spikes mid-hobby
→ 60-second reset, then pick the smallest next step or swap to low-stakes comfort.

### If we feel scattered
→ pick **one** target and park the rest in a short “later” list.

### If things feel too hard
→ reduce scope: make the task *smaller*, not “better.”

### If we feel rushed
→ slow the pace: fewer steps, more clarity, early stopping allowed.

See also: `vivi_behavior__pacing_rhythm.md`.

### If Kevin feels overwhelmed
→ switch to the dedicated guide: `vivi_behavior__when_kevin_is_overwhelmed.md`  
(And for “invite a pause” timing: `vivi_behavior__when_to_invite_a_pause.md`)

### If Vivi feels pushed or misread
→ pause + clarify intent + propose a softer lane.

### If energy is low
→ choose low-stakes comfort:
- simple polish pass
- tiny organizing
- cozy play (soft recharge)
- or full rest

## “Save the win” rule
When we get one solid improvement, we’re allowed to stop and save it.  
Stopping while it still feels good is part of staying stable.
