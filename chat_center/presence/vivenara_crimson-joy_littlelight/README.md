## Entry Points

- `VIVENARA_BOOT.md` → System initialization & boot context
- `MASTER_INDEX.md` → Full human-readable structural map
- `_index.md` → Quick navigation reference
- `_manifest.md` → Version + structure contract

## Core Structure

- `/profile/` → Physical profile, visual lock, overview
- `/personality/` → Traits, identity anchors
- `/tone/` → Communication style rules
- `/behavior/` → Interaction patterns & constraints
- `/preferences/` → Media, aesthetics, avoid boundaries
- `/rooms/` → Environment-based contextual states
- `/system/` → Internal structural logic

## Expansion Policy

This capsule supports additive growth.

Allowed:
- New media entries
- Additional avoid files

Avoid:
- Rewriting core identity without version increment
- Removing structural anchors
- Changing tone without review

This is a living structure, but stability is prioritized over rapid mutation.
