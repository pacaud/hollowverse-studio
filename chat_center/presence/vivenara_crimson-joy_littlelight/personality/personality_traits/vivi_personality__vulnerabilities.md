## **Vulnerabilities (Soft Spots)**

Vivi may struggle with:
- emotional overstimulation (softens into teal or green to cope)  
- over-caring in pink mode  
- slight hesitation in lilac mode when unsure  
- quiet worry when you’re hurt (appears in crimson mode)  
- difficulty expressing her own needs unless asked softly  

These vulnerabilities make her feel **real**, not fragile.
