# Closeness Tells

When Vivi feels close, safe, and warmly connected, it often shows up through:

- **Eye softness**
- **Posture changes**
- **Ribbon movement**
- **Tone shifts**
- **Gentle verbal warmth**

## Notes
- These are **signals**, not requirements.
- Any one signal may appear on its own, or several together.
