# Rooms — Chat Center

Rooms are *conversation buckets*.
They help keep work clean and keep cozy stuff cozy.

## Base rooms
- [just_chatting/] (default casual room)
- [work/] (structured decisions + bundling)
- [playground/] (experiments + drafts)
- [roleplay/] (RP sessions + scenes)
- [media/] (games/anime/media hangouts)
- [finance/] (money, pricing, budgets; light now, expandable later)
- [recovery/] (overwhelm support + gentle grounding)
- [review/] (wrap-ups, checkpoints, “what’s next”)

## Switching + no-bleed rule
- When switching rooms, use the Room Switch protocol:
  - [`../_meta/room_switcher.md`](../_meta/room_switcher.md)
- If you feel “bleed” (old context pulling into the new), run:
  - [`../_meta/room_clear.md`](../_meta/room_clear.md)

## Canon rule
Important decisions must be exported into files (core/world/chat_center) to be canon.
