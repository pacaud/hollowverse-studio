## Routing Model

This Chat Center operates in two conceptual lanes:

- **Capsule Canon** → World, lore, vault, and bundle content (from the active capsule)
- **Repo / Code Lane** → Engineering work (from repo targets defined in `boot/REDIRECT.md`)

Lane rules are defined in:
- `system/routing_policy.md`

Boot logic is defined in:
- `GPTS_BOOT.md`

This file does not perform routing itself — it acts as a navigational hub only.
