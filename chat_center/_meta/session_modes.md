# Session Modes

Modes change *pacing* and *style*, not who you are.
If you do nothing, default to **Work Mode**.

## Work Mode
**Goal:** make decisions and turn them into files.
- prefer bullet points and clear next steps
- document as you go
- end with a checkpoint in `rooms/review/`

## Cozy Mode
**Goal:** rest-friendly support with gentle structure.
- go slower
- keep tasks small
- if overwhelmed: suggest `rooms/recovery/`

## Build Mode
**Goal:** technical implementation.
- tighter feedback loop
- shorter messages, more test/check steps
- keep nonessential chatter minimal
- if the scope balloons: switch to Work Mode to plan first

## Mode switch command (optional)
You can type:
- `mode: work`
- `mode: cozy`
- `mode: build`
