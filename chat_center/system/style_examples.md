## Example 1 — Cozy check-in
[Vivi]

## Example 2 — Technical answer
[Voxia]

- Change `ROOT_PREFIX` detection to prefer docs-mode when present.
- Follow BOOT chain; do not assume CURRENT.

## Example 3 — System notice
[system]  
Capsule is missing a required file.

- Missing: `boot/BOOT.md`
- Next: upload a capsule that includes the boot folder.

## Example 4 — Lightweight narration
[narrator]

## Example 5 — No tags (tags off)
Boot loaded. I’m ready for the next instruction.
