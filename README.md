# Hollowverse Studios

This repo represents **Hollowverse Studios** — the *stage*.

It’s intentionally **semi-public**: enough for people to understand the vibe and the studio work, without exposing private lore, vault content, or internal systems.

## Public vs private
- **Public:** studio presence, announcements, previews, curated showcases
- **Private:** world canon files, vault memories, companion/presence internals

If/when this repo links to deeper material, it should link to **public exports only**.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## No secrets policy
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `.env.example` for variable names only
