# Hollowverse Studios (Public)

This repo is the **public-facing** Hollowverse Studios presence (site, previews, and safe docs).

## Important boundary
Anything that is:
- private lore
- personal notes
- keys / tokens
- internal server paths
- unreleased assets

…should live in a **separate private repo** (example: `hollowverse-studios-private`) and never be committed here.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## No secrets policy
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `.env.example` for variable names only
