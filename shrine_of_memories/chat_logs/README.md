# Chat Logs — Shrine Capture

This folder stores archived conversations from GPT / Voxia / companions.

Goal:
- Keep the Shrine + Vault as the long-term memory,
- So GPT web history can be cleared without losing important threads.

Structure (v1):

- `by_date/YYYY-MM-DD/` — chats grouped by date
- `by_gpt/NAME/` — chats grouped by assistant / profile

File naming:

- `2025-11-22__vivi_core__hollowverse_studio_setup.md`
- `2025-11-22__voxia__vault_bridge_planning.md`

All logs are **read-only** from Voxia’s perspective.
